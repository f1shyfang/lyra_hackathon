I believed in its innovation, mission, and future—not just as a car company, but as a leader in sustainable energy. I didn’t just buy a Tesla; I invested in its vision, seeing long-term potential and leadership that could change the world. But today, I drive with a bumper sticker that reads, “I bought this before Elon went crazy.” I’ve lost close to $300,000 on Tesla stock—much of it due to Tesla’s freefall under Musk’s leadership. Billions in shareholder value have been wiped out—not just from EV competition, but because Musk has alienated customers, investors, and industries with reckless, divisive choices. This isn’t about one bad quarter. It’s about failed leadership. When a CEO spends more time on conspiracy theories and political grandstanding than leading and innovating, investors lose faith, customers walk away, and Tesla—once the EV industry’s undisputed leader—bleeds market share and brand loyalty. Tesla is more than Elon Musk. Keeping him at the helm is a liability, not an asset. If the board refuses to act, the company will continue its downward spiral.

Leave Elon Musk alone. He may have views you disagree with, he does for me, but what you are doing is hurting the regular people who work at his companies and both the left and right, have been doing it for years. Before someone says that fires people and are upset by it, he hires substantially more people than he fires. How is it that you are upset at X, which did no removals of posts regarding election related stuff, as being an impact on the elections yet you were okay with it heavily being used by Democrats and the FBI to suppress information that would have negatively affected their political chances and cancel people? It was absolutely used as a political tool but is much more centric now. Once you all remove yourselves from the news and social media and it's influence you will see how bad you are being manipulated. It's actually nice on this side.

Combine this with a CEO that has the foresight to understand the global picture of financial sustainability and path that America is on (bankruptcy due to continued growth in debt), you HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES when you spend more than you earn. Change is scary. It brings pain. People will be upset. Does Elon rub many people the wrong way? Yes! But that is what happens when you focus on fixing a broken system the size of the US govt. Government programs need to be audited just like public and private companies in order to protect the investment of the owners (taxpayers). Whether it’s Elon or someone else, our government spending needs to be lean and efficient. Gone are the days of funding pet projects with taxpayer dollars that line the pockets of a select few and don’t benefit the taxpayers. Thank you Elon for stepping up.

While Musk has played a critical role in Tesla’s growth, his recent behavior and decisions have become a liability rather than an asset. Below are the primary reasons why a leadership change is necessary: 1. Declining Stock Price and Shareholder Losses 2. Damage to Tesla’s Brand and Reputation 3. Significant Decline in Sales and Market Share 4. Distractions from Tesla’s Core Business 5. Legal and Regulatory Risks Under Musk’s Leadership 6. Loss of Key Talent and Internal Turmoil 7. Need for a Professional and Stable Leadership It’s Time for a Leadership Change!

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tesla-motors_new-model-y-deliveries-in-europe-starting-activity-7303864036255846401-DQQI,"Hi Elon (If you read anything) In summary: In everything, there is a scale adapted according to size to carry out tasks and functions. This is what is observed, the same pattern. Everything is perfectly scaled and adjusted. There are no excesses. There is consistency and equilibrium at all scales. 1.) At the atomic level: Quantum communication (femtoseconds) is perfect for chemical reactions and molecular bonds. It does not need more speed. 2.-) At the biological level: Nerve signals (milliseconds) are perfect for coordinating organisms metres in size. The brain does not need faster communication because the body cannot react any quicker. 3.) At the planetary level: Radio waves (speed of light) are perfect for global communication. Earth has a circumference of ~40,000 km; light travels it in 0.13 seconds. 4.-) At the cosmic level: Here lies the mystery. With distances of millions of light-years, light is terribly inadequate for any meaningful coordination or communication between galaxies. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pablo-baena-vela-a83967332_protocol-comm-v1-activity-7401808543622012929-OJFW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAFPKp0MBzFx_wjJq-XtN3Y9QWZD-N57s9O8",Pablo Baena Vela .,"--Project Manager Certificaciones Internacionales, IA/ML LLMs El primero gana, el segundo pierde y los demás participan.

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tesla-motors_engineering-cybertruck-for-maximum-safety-activity-7298163955611377664-d5Ga,"Tesla recently released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software package in China. However, the FSD functionality has not been implemented in the majority of vehicles equipped with the 3.0 hardware, Instead, it is only available on a small portion of vehicles with the 4.0 hardware. Despite this, Tesla has been misleading consumers who already own vehicles with the 3.0 hardware and have purchased the 32,000 RMB assisted driving package, encouraging them to spend an additional 32,000 RMB on the FSD software package, which offers no functionality for their vehicles. Tesla has also refused to issue refunds. On the mobile app for vehicles with the 3.0 hardware, the purchase of the FSD package is shown as successful, and the vehicle's system displays a successful upgrade. However, the vehicles do not actually possess full self-driving capabilities. This has led many 3.0 hardware owners in mainland China to mistakenly believe their vehicles are equipped with FSD functionality, resulting in numerous traffic violations such as running red lights, crossing lanes, and even car accidents. This poses a significant threat to the safety of consumers in mainland China and constitutes malicious exploitation and fraudulent behavior by Tesla.",Qiang(Leo) Liu,CEO CTO at Leo Motion Ltd.,,Founder/Executive,0.9,negative,critical,credibility_overclaim,Harmful

When Tesla would always contact me about moving to California or Texas, I would remind him that in the Southeast USA there is a huge part supplier network for most OEMs and that Trump plays golf in Florida and not Texas with the Armadillo. Also, mostly nonunion and Republican which is Trump base. Now a new Tesla plant would be expensive but joining up with Nissan would make this unnecessary. Tesla is one dimensional in the car business with only BEVs and you have to be able to bend with the wind when EVs are out of favor for a while or get killed on sales. Nissan has a major presence in Japan and Detroit. Nissan is in need of cash and not as much debt as Renault. Could use Tesla BEV knowledge to develop their EV lineup and couldn’t hurt making their Infiniti models more up to date. Would give Nissan a bigger foothold in the California market and Tesla technology advancements. Would help Nissan erase the legacy of Carlos and maybe improve their quality which had been slipping from his term at Nissan. Nissan is trying to lure the younger population into buying their cars and with a Tesla tie up, they should be able to sell more to the Millennials in the USA & Japan.",Alex Umbdenstock,Manufacturing/Industrial/Process Engineer/New Vehicle Development & Launch Japan-Tennessee/New Bus Launch Minnesota-Alabama/New Military Aerospace Repair & Facility Development,,Software Engineer,0.9,neutral,neutral,neutral,Harmless

The criteria MUST be: statistically at least as safe as human drivers. And that’s actually not a very high bar. Human drivers cause an ESTIMATED six million accidents per year in the US… so many that nobody knows the exact number. Those accidents result in about 38,000 deaths and 4.7 million hospitalizations per year. It’s about 1.3 deaths per 100-million-vehicle-miles-traveled (100MVMT), about 1850 accidents per 100MVMT. Tesla cars have already driven over 3.3 billion miles on FDS or Autopilot. Their at-fault accident rate is about 441 per 100MVMT, less than one-quarter that of human drivers. The fatality rate is about 0.2 per 100MVMT, less than one-sixth that of human drivers! Already, Tesla’s self-driving is statistically MUCH safer than humans, 4-6 times safer. And Tesla’s algorithms literally get better every day. Self-driving cars are not the problem; they are the solution. Hopefully, politicians won’t deny us that solution because of some neoluddism.

Seriously have you ever driven someplace and during your trip realize that you weren't paying very close attention on the last few streets? And kind of shake yourself to pay closer attention?

I can't wait. The first time I tested it, I was angry. It was so nerve wracking that I thought it was 5 years away. I had a month free test. But once the free test was almost over.

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tesla-motors_y-activity-7288554240501837824-rluW,"Shame on Tesla! Tesla recently released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software package in China. However, the FSD functionality has not been implemented in the majority of vehicles equipped with the 3.0 hardware, Instead, it is only available on a small portion of vehicles with the 4.0 hardware. Tesla has been misleading consumers who already own vehicles with the 3.0 hardware and have purchased the 32,000 RMB assisted driving package, encouraging them to spend an additional 32,000 RMB on the FSD software package, which offers no functionality for their vehicles. Tesla has also refused to issue refunds. On the mobile app for vehicles with the 3.0 hardware, the purchase of the FSD package is shown as successful, and the vehicle's system displays a successful upgrade. However, the vehicles do not actually possess full self-driving capabilities. This has led many 3.0 hardware owners in mainland China to mistakenly believe their vehicles are equipped with FSD functionality, resulting in numerous traffic violations such as running red lights, crossing lanes, and even car accidents. This poses a significant threat to the safety of consumers in mainland China and constitutes malicious exploitation and fraudulent behavior by Tesla.",Qiang(Leo) Liu,CEO CTO at Leo Motion Ltd.,,Founder/Executive,0.9,neutral,neutral,neutral,Harmless

I’ve spent the last few years working in the automotive industry here, and I strongly believe EVs are the future—not just globally, but also in Africa. My goal is to become a pioneer in bringing electric vehicle innovation to Cameroon. That’s why I’m reaching out with humility to ask: would there be any opportunity for me to join your team—even as a learner or intern—to better understand EV design, construction, and deployment?

When you’ve failed on the most basic safety features of a car, literally? Before you test your car with any protocols, I think you should check the basic safety features first. For instance, people should be able to open doors without getting destroyed their fingers, and it would be common sense. I have proof to show that this truck literally destroyed my finger. This happened to me. My nine-year-old son was a big fan of Tesla, and as he saw what happened, he doesn’t even want to get in a Tesla anymore. I would say that any parent who owns a Cyber Truck should not let their kids open doors. Those doors can easily take off a child’s finger, as it took a chunk out of mine.

Got the idea after seeing multiple cars and buses catch fire in summer heat. It’s designed to detect thermal spikes and alert the driver before it becomes dangerous.

Yet feel the need to downplay it. I own a model 3 2021. I love how i dont have to spend $400 on gas every month... or $75 oil changes every 3k miles. I love how i can just connect it at home and it will only cost me $9 a month extra on my energy bill. It feels good not having to worry about Gas prices It Feels good not waiting 25 min to charge at a station... (God knows the world will end if that happends ) smh.

While using self-parking, I encountered several issues but wasn’t sure where to report them. I appreciate the improvements so far and believe there are still opportunities for further enhancements without adding new hardware. Here are some suggestions 1. Security Enhancement 1: Unlock the car only after the phone is unlocked. This prevents potential theft if someone gains access to the phone. Make this feature optional for users to activate. 2. Security Enhancement 2: Introduce face recognition via the driver-facing camera to authenticate the driver before allowing the car to operate. Again, this should be optional. 3. Reporting Issues: Add a quick-access button (on-screen or on the steering wheel) to report issues encountered. This feature could capture a 1–2 minute video for Tesla’s review. 4. Improved Auto Climate: The Auto Climate feature underperforms in winter compared to manual settings. Improvements in this area would enhance the user experience.

But this it is not because in reality there is a software company that has developed an app to use in place of the tesla app, which enables on android those same functions that tesla declares it cannot make work on android, furthermore the same app gives the possibility to manage from smartwatches like my garmin fenix 7 (already for more than 1 year) the same functions that tesla introduced with its latest update on apple Watch. Unfortunately the only problem is that this alternative app not developed by tesla has an additional annual cost. Now I would just like to understand if Tesla is deliberately avoiding implementing these functions on devices other than iPhones (Android), considering that other software companies have implemented them on Android. and i'm a model3 owner",Andrea Ballin,IT Manager - Analista Tecnico Funzionale IT- System Integrator - Mirth Connect channel developer - Healthcare System Integrator - IT Technical Specialist,,Software Engineer,0.9,negative,critical,culture_misalignment,Harmful

Its vertically integrated approach enables rapid advancements in battery efficiency, range, and manufacturing. Tesla’s over-the-air software updates, Autopilot, and energy ecosystem are unmatched. Meanwhile, its Supercharger network eliminates range anxiety, giving it a significant lead. Tesla’s agility, vision, and first-mover advantage make it the benchmark for the EV revolution, while traditional automakers struggle to catch up.","Eduardo E Chang MD, M.","""Pulmonary, Sleep & Critical Care Medicine Specialist"" , ""knowledge is Power"", ""Kaizen "" Every day is an opportunity to improve even if it is by 1%.
