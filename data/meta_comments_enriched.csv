https://www.linkedin.com/posts/meta_lifeatmeta-womenintech-gracehopper2025-activity-7406713486380085248-6R72,"This post is a powerful testament to the strength of diverse leadership and a growth-mindset culture at Meta. Seeing Hind Hobeika, Kelly Ingham, Ming Hua, and Shira Gordon share their journeys is incredibly motivating. The key takeaways resonate deeply: 1. ""Nonlinear paths embraced"" is a crucial message. It validates the experiences of so many professionals whose careers aren't a straight ladder, but a mosaic of skills, pivots, and learning. 2. ""Curiosity fueled their rise"" highlights that in fast-moving fields like wearables and AI, technical skill must be paired with a relentless desire to learn and question. 3. The tangible outcome of ""5 products shipped in one year"" proves that this leadership style isn't just inspirational—it's exceptionally effective and execution-oriented. By showcasing these women leaders at Grace Hopper, Meta does more than share career tips; it actively models the future of tech: one that is innovative, human-centric, and built by a wide range of perspectives. This is how you redefine careers and build the next generation of products. Thank you to the panelists and Julia L. for sharing these insights.

Has Meta abandoned the foundational models Llama , now that Avagardo has been brought into the picture? Question to CTO: Given that the US military uses Llama , through third parties ( eg, Oracle Predictions, Andurl Helmets) , how would you explain the introduction of Avagardo at the expence of or as an enhancement of Llama, to the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff ( CJCS)? Had I been a US citizen, I would have taken the next available flight to Pentagon and would have requested the CJCS to immediately ring up Meta HQ to ask that very question. It is that serious. ""Don't ask what the country has done for you, ask what have you done for the country"". This would have been the moment I lived for. The ideal candidate is an American Mother with her days old baby in her arms, requesting the CJCS to ring up Meta HQ and requests the CJCS to kiss her baby on the forehead and give his blessings, so the baby serves as a distinguished fighter pilot in US Air Force Or Navy, when s/he is old enough.

But there’s an important point beneath all of this: larger ad-foundation models still operate inside a short-horizon optimisation loop. They excel at prediction and generation, yet they do not maintain a persistent internal model of why they make the decisions they make. In my research on external self-maintenance architectures (eTSM-PSS7), we consistently find that the bottleneck isn’t scale or training throughput — it’s identity stability and long-horizon value coherence. Without a stable self-model, any high-capacity recommender eventually drifts: semantic drift, preference drift, and alignment drift. GEM pushes the ceiling of scale.

The concept is simple yet disruptive: an auction driven by emotional responses, transforming human reactions into real valuation indicators. EmoBid creates a completely new experience, where emotional data guides decisions, interactions, and opportunities within the platform. It opens the door to new forms of engagement, analysis, and value creation — something that doesn’t exist in the market yet. The project is currently in its structuring and validation phase, and I’m moving forward with prototypes and experience design. 🔹 Applied emotional economy 🔹 Real-time behavioral interpretation 🔹 A strong opportunity for innovation and market differentiation 🔹 A scalable concept for technology, marketing, gaming, and social platforms If you work with innovation, technology, human behavior, AI, or simply resonate with ideas that challenge the ordinary, I’d be happy to exchange insights — and perhaps even build something together.

The Disable: Accounts are flagged or disabled by AI bots with zero human review. The ""Upsell"": Immediately after crippling reach, the platform pushes you to ""Boost"" posts or buy Ads to regain visibility. This isn't a glitch; it feels like a feature. It is a ""pay-to-play"" trap designed to extract revenue from businesses that have no other options. Because they hold a monopoly on social connection, there is zero accountability. There is no customer support, only automated loops. To my fellow business owners: Do not rely solely on these platforms.

My Instagram account was suspended, but the entire appeal system is broken. All the official links and forms redirect back to the Help Center with no actual form, and since I’m locked out I can’t use the in-app appeal either. Every route you provide loops back to the same dead end. I’ve been on your platforms for over 15 years, and I’m about to lose all my photos, conversations and history because the appeal flow itself is not working.

My account is currently disabled and unavailable, and I believe this may have been a misunderstanding. I have not violated any community guidelines or any terms and conditions. These accounts were created a long time ago and have been consistently used for personal, work, business, and school purposes. I have always followed the platform’s rules and have never engaged in any activities that go against your policies. That is why this situation is extremely alarming for us users, as experiencing something like this greatly affects our daily lives. -",Princess Jane Salazar,"Looking for a position in a reputable company where I can learn, expand my knowledge and put what I've learned into practice and allows me to contribute to the company.",Other,positive,questioning,supportive

A rigorous proof shows that Regenerative Intelligence (\(\pi{regen}\)) strictly dominates Scalar Optimization (\(\pi{opt}\)). - Regenerative Intelligence grows the viable future unboundedly. - Scalar Optimization collapses viability to zero almost surely. This is the first formal proof that love beats greed in the long run: deliberate constraint-creation (“love”) enlarges everyone’s future, while short-term reward maximization (“greed”) mathematically fails. 💡 Takeaway: If your strategy isn’t actively growing the viable future, it’s not just risky—it’s mathematically doomed. ---",Caleb Flynn,Unemployed at xAI,Other,positive,supportive,supportive

I have always tried to follow the Community Standards, and I have never knowingly posted anything that would violate Facebook’s policies. Until this incident, I had never received warnings, restrictions, or any previous issues. The sudden loss of access is causing significant inconvenience, not only because of the personal memories stored on my account, but also because this account is linked to important connections and communication channels in my daily life.

I’m not exaggerating when I say this has started affecting my income, my mental health, and my ability to serve my clients.

As someone working on a SaaS platform (MaliAI) to streamline workflows for accountants, I see parallels in how technology can simplify complex processes while fostering collaboration. Your work on emissions data transparency could inspire similar approaches in financial tech, ensuring sustainability is embedded in decision-making.

This decision is clearly the result of a malfunction in Facebook’s moderation AI, which increasingly makes arbitrary decisions without proper human review. I am one of thousands of users who have been unfairly affected by these automated suspensions, often without clear notice, without a precise explanation, and most importantly, without any effective appeal process. This situation is unacceptable and severely undermines users’ trust in the platform. My account is an essential tool for me, and I refuse to be the victim of a faulty algorithm. I therefore request the immediate reopening of my account and a thorough human review of my case. I also want to make it clear that I am fully determined to defend my rights.

Great advice. As a former user, can I say no to Meta’s subpar customer service, flawed appeals system, and total lack of human support? My Facebook account was disabled in March 2025. My Instagram account was followed in June. No warning. No explanation. No one to talk to. Just a silent lockout. And I’m not alone; thousands of users are reporting the same treatment. If Meta is allowed to say “no” to basic accountability, Then users have every right to say “no” to platforms that ignore their own policies, violate trust, and pretend there’s no issue. Even the BBC and other media outlets have reported on this growing problem. A petition now has 43,000+ signatures from affected users: 🔗 https://www.change.org/p/meta-wrongfully-disabling-accounts-with-no-human-customer-support So yes I’m saying no. ❌ No to silence. ❌ No to automated injustice. ❌ No to being treated like a number. ❌ And no to gaslighting dressed up as empowerment.

Chciałbym dołożyć perspektywę z zupełnie innego miejsca — z terenu, z pracy z ludźmi, z realnych systemów energetycznych. W Polsce tworzę modele AI, które działają nie w salach konferencyjnych, lecz w domach użytkowników PV, pomp ciepła i nowych technologii, gdzie pojawia się codzienny chaos informacyjny i brak wsparcia. I widzę jedno: 🔸 AI ma największy wpływ tam, gdzie ludzie są pozostawieni sami z technologią, nie tam, gdzie prowadzi się o niej dyskusje. 🔸 Prawdziwy przełom zaczyna się, gdy model nie tylko „odpowiada”, ale bierze odpowiedzialność za prowadzenie użytkownika krok po kroku. 🔸 Najbardziej innowacyjne nie są już same algorytmy — tylko to, jak AI łączy człowieka z systemem, w sposób etyczny i zrozumiały. Dlatego budując WitnessAI pracuję nad jednym: systemową, etyczną inteligencją użytkową, która w realnym środowisku pomaga ludziom zrozumieć i oswoić technologię, zamiast ich przytłaczać. Świat AI potrzebuje nie tylko wielkich modeli, ale także jednostek, które łączą je z człowiekiem.

Despite paying for verification and support, responses have been generic “please wait” messages with no escalation or case ownership—this is unacceptable for paying customers and creators. This is a broken state machine: the system demands an additional ID but offers no upload mechanism, leaving the account locked and harming campaign commitments and partner obligations. Call to action: enable the alternate ID upload flow or complete manual review immediately, assign a real case ID, and publish an ETA from the Identity/Account Access teams. Public accountability matters—commit here, in this thread, to fixing the verification loop and to improving paid support beyond copy‑paste replies. Creators and businesses affected by the same verification dead end: add a comment below with “ID loop—no upload option” so this gets prioritized and tracked by the team.

The hackers then opened a business account in my name and are posting advertisements encouraging gambling. The paradox is that I can see the hacker accounts in the page roles, but since you have restricted my account, I cannot remove them from my business account in any way, and they continue to post campaigns undisturbed.

Facebook, linked to the same email, doesn’t help. I changed my phone number, and the only verification options are SMS or two-factor backup codes — both unusable if I’ve lost access. The help page just loops back to the same links, with no solution. The Meta Help Hub offers no real support — no chat, no email, no effective AI.

Since then, I haven’t been able to get back in. The problem: All accounts share the same email, but I can’t validate the logged-out one through any of the others. Facebook, linked to the same email, doesn’t help. I changed my phone number, and the only verification options are SMS or two-factor backup codes — both unusable if I’ve lost access. The help page just loops back to the same links, with no solution. The Meta Help Hub offers no real support — no chat, no email, no effective AI. I’ve been locked out of my main business account for two days, which I rely on for clients and communication. 📢 I urge someone from Meta/Instagram to see this. I’d rather not take legal action, but right now it seems to be the only option.

The help page just loops back to the same links, with no solution. The Meta Help Hub offers no real support — no chat, no email, no effective AI. I’ve been locked out of my main business account for two days, which I rely on for clients and communication. 📢 I urge someone from Meta/Instagram to see this. I’d rather not take legal action, but right now it seems to be the only option. Meta must urgently improve its account recovery process and user support — especially for professional accounts. #Instagram #Meta #CustomerSupport #Usability",Carol Zuchetti,Farmacêutica-Bioquímica/ Psicanalista,Other,negative,critical,skepticism
