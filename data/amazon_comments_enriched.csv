https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amazon_chestnuts-arent-the-only-things-roasting-activity-7407213606997614592-3_fi,"Playful moments like this signal something deeper than humor. When AI is comfortable operating in everyday, low-stakes interactions, it shows how far trust and familiarity have already progressed. At a system level, this matters because adoption doesn’t scale through capability alone — it scales through normalization. Features that feel casual today quietly reset expectations for how AI shows up at work tomorrow. The real design challenge isn’t wit or personality, but knowing where lightness builds comfort without eroding judgment. That balance is where human-AI collaboration becomes sustainable. #AI #Alexa #HumanAI #ProductDesign #LongTermThinking",Sheng-hao Wang,Tech × Beverage × APAC Strategy | Founder’s Co‑Pilot,,Founder/Executive,0.9,positive,supportive,supportive,Helpful

They seek to dominate the world through greater learning and knowledge. They use interactions with diverse people as a springboard to demonstrate relative advantage. They exhibit a single-minded focus on making money. There is no verification of what is right or what is right. Any methodology must lead to confidence. There are no specifically codified rules for confidence. The most important factor here is your own field experience. The more you experience failure and hardship, the more this power grows.

Instead I received a tiny book‑sized “deer” taped to a piece of cardboard. 🙄 I opened a return request, but the seller now says I have to self‑ship the item back – after three days of calling customer care and getting the run‑around (“investigation in progress”, “no update”).

After 26 years — from building a Wall Street talent division to running my own agency — one truth stands: Recruiting didn’t evolve. It expired. Why recruiting failed: 1. Sales tactics, no substance 2. No real track record or cycle experience 3. Mandate-chasing over strategy 4. Overexposing your value and IP 5. Résumé blasting without consent 6. No desire to understand your goals 7. Loyalty to clients — not you 8. Same “usual suspect” clients 9. Ghosting when you’re not a fit 10. Zero transparency or feedback You need representation — not résumé-pushing. Nearly 20 years ago, I built a Talent Agency model — confidential, strategic, long-term — treating your career like what it truly is: an appreciating asset. You’re not a transaction.

As of November 28, the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) has reported 174 lives lost—mothers, fathers, children, neighbors. Hundreds more are injured, and 183 people are still missing, as rescue teams continue searching through thick mud, debris, and collapsed homes. Thousands of survivors are now left with nothing—no homes, no food, no clean water, and no sense of safety. Many are living in temporary shelters, while struggling to understand how their lives changed so suddenly. They need us. They need warmth, medical supplies, clean water, blankets, and the reassurance that the world has not forgotten them. In moments like these, humanity is all we have.

The timeline is unacceptable: 1. 28th November 2025: I placed the order, and the system explicitly promised delivery the next day, 29th November 2025, before 10 PM. 2. 29th November 2025: I stayed home the entire day specifically to receive this delivery. I received the delivery agent’s number and attempted to contact him, but he repeatedly failed to pick up the call. 3. 30th November 2025: I received an insulting email claiming that ""Customer was not available at home to receive the order"" and that ""Payment was not ready at the time of receiving the order."" Let me be unequivocally clear: This is a complete lie and a fabrication. I was at my residence the entire day on November 29th.

For a company of its scale, Amazon still struggles to support global, internationally mobile customers. My recent Black Friday case shows this clearly: Nov 30: Placed a ~$1k order. Immediately held for “suspicious activity” (EU card + US delivery). Submitted documents as requested. EU bank statements don’t show card numbers, so I included a photo of my card. Dec 2: Instead of resolving verification, Amazon reset my entire login and cancelled the order. Dec 4: Received the same verification request again and resubmitted. Dec 5–6: My account was locked, then closed entirely—along with remaining gift card balance. Support was almost unreachable due to automated loops and international call costs. This highlights a real opportunity for Amazon to strengthen processes for globally mobile customers. A global company should be able to recognize legitimate international profiles.

When I was returning it, it was showing that the refund would be received within four hours of pickup, but now the email is saying that the refund will not be received for 13 days. It is very disgusting and very sad. This is Amazon's service. Sophia, the customs agent of Amazon, is saying that it takes 13 days for the balance to be credited to Amazon Pay, otherwise it takes 20 days for the money to be credited to the account. Do you think the customers are fools? Some other companies refund within 5-7 days, but Amazon will not refund for a month.

Fake deals at their finest 🎭. So here’s the story:I ordered 3 bottles of shampoo 🧴🧴🧴 — yes, the shocking, world-shattering amount of THREE bottles — during a promotion Amazon proudly advertised.And what does Amazon do? They cancel the order and claim the quantity is “more than allowed for personal use” 🚫. Wow, incredible 👏. Three bottles. Truly dangerous quantities. Honestly, it’s hilarious 😂 — Amazon encourages customers to “take advantage of the offer,” then punishes them for doing exactly that. Promotions pushing you to buy more 📣… policies blocking you when you actually try 🛑. If this isn’t peak hypocrisy, I don’t know what is. And if these promotions aren’t meant to be used, maybe just say that from the start instead of wasting customers’ time 🤷‍♀️?

Instead I received a tiny book‑sized “deer” taped to a piece of cardboard. 🙄 I opened a return request, but the seller now says I have to *self‑ship* the item back – after three days of calling customer care and getting the run‑around (“investigation in progress”, “no update”). They finally promised a refund _and_ shipping costs, but only if I cover the return logistics myself. Order No.402-8430968-7509955.

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amazon_join-amazon-web-services-aws-ceo-matt-garman-activity-7401766262567010304-Hzr4,"The innovations highlighted at AWS re:Invent 2025 are not just incremental improvements , they signal a major shift in how enterprises can approach AI deployment, customization, and infrastructure decisions. One of the most impactful announcements is the Nova family of models, especially Nova Pro, which offers a remarkable 73 percent cost reduction compared to leading alternatives like Claude 3.5 Sonnet while delivering lower latency and higher throughput. This cost-performance edge opens the door for large-scale enterprise deployments, especially for real-time and agent-based AI applications. Equally significant is Amazon’s focus on customizability, with tools like Nova Forge and serverless fine-tuning on SageMaker. This allows organizations to adapt cutting-edge models with proprietary datasets, maintaining both model performance and data sovereignty , a critical concern for regulated industries and any enterprise managing sensitive information. AgentCore and the new suite of Frontier Agents demonstrate AWS’s intent to accelerate intelligent automation, giving developers more control and flexibility to build autonomous agents for complex workflows. Trainium3’s general availability adds another layer, enabling faster and more cost-effective model training at scale , a key factor as more businesses look to own and fine-tune their AI models. Finally, AWS’s strategic integration with partners like Nvidia and the broader shift from a centralized AI strategy to more distributed, customizable ecosystems will directly impact how CIOs and CISOs evaluate their AI investments. For organizations navigating the balance between performance, costs, data control, and compliance, these announcements represent a real alternative to the status quo and a new playbook for enterprise AI deployment.",Johnny Da Silva,"Chef d'entreprise @ Axians | Expert MultiCloud, Cybersécurité, Services Managés & Transformation Numérique",,Security,0.9,positive,supportive,supportive,Helpful

Embed 2 shock cameras inside the football. the 1st camera we see embedded directly inside the nose/tip point where the ball joins. next, camera embedded on the side. Purpose - It's function is to capture areal shots or high-point touchdowns/interceptions. Einstein Way - The Technology: Gyroscopes The function I am describing is achieved using a gyroscope (or specifically, an electronic gyroscopic stabilization system). You would need a miniature, motorized, three-axis gimbal system built right into the ball though guys.

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amazon_amazon-is-investing-up-to-50-billion-to-activity-7398753505936695296-JtIs,"This announcement represents a watershed moment for the modernization of U.S. government digital infrastructure. With 1.3 gigawatts of new, dedicated computing power, the scale of this investment positions AWS at the forefront of enabling mission-critical applications across defense, intelligence, healthcare, and scientific research. The focus on secure, classified environments like AWS GovCloud and the integration of advanced AI services such as SageMaker and Bedrock directly address the federal need for both technological agility and regulatory compliance. At the same time, this move highlights the increasing competitive pressure among hyperscalers to shape public sector AI adoption. Recent symbolic pricing offers by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google to federal entities signal a race for strategic market share. As agencies deepen their reliance on private cloud and AI providers, questions around data sovereignty, governance, and long-term control become even more pressing. For IT decision-makers, there are key considerations: the operational benefits of accelerated AI integration must be balanced with robust security frameworks, auditable systems, and strategies for sustainable energy use given the massive scale-up in computational resources. The alignment with federal AI policy and the focus on air-gapped, multi-classified environments is promising, but continuous oversight and adaptability will be essential for maintaining national leadership in this rapidly evolving landscape.",Johnny Da Silva,"Chef d'entreprise @ Axians | Expert MultiCloud, Cybersécurité, Services Managés & Transformation Numérique",,Security,0.9,positive,supportive,supportive,Helpful

Through profound thought, we have created a history of civilization. The Industrial Revolution has expanded the scope of human benefits. Advancing technological development is pushing us toward a world of science fiction. We are in a time when control and coordination are essential. We are entering an era of self-righteousness, where everyone claims to be right. Leading nations seek to dominate the world using power as a weapon. Corporations, bloated by technological development, are focusing their energies on profit. Weak nations and underprivileged companies are preoccupied with the world's perception. We have forgotten that the world operates according to the laws of circulation. A humble but powerful revolt is beginning. This is the emanation of the Industrial Revolution into the Human Revolution. Organic food production, disease vaccine development, safety-focused technology transfer, and a return to nature.

After filing multiple HR complaints regarding racial discrimination I experienced, I was wrongfully terminated. Meanwhile, the manager responsible for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior, Genelle Rose, including exposing team members to sexual content during a meeting, remains in her position. During this process, I had HR meetings with Alicia Panta, Hannah Park, Mike Gomez, and Rato, and was told that all of this behavior is considered acceptable by Amazon. It is disheartening to see that speaking up about discrimination can result in retaliation, while those engaging in misconduct face no consequences. Black employees and other marginalized groups deserve to work in environments where they are respected, valued, and treated equitably.

After filing multiple HR complaints regarding racial discrimination I experienced, I was wrongfully terminated. Meanwhile, the manager responsible for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior, Genelle Rose, including exposing team members to sexual content during a meeting, remains in her position. During this process, I had HR meetings with Alicia Panta, Hannah Park, Mike Gomez, and Rato, and was told that all of this behavior is considered acceptable by Amazon. It is disheartening to see that speaking up about discrimination can result in retaliation, while those engaging in misconduct face no consequences. Black employees and other marginalized groups deserve to work in environments where they are respected, valued, and treated equitably.

Their delivery partners are committing fraud, and Amazon’s response is extremely casual. Here’s what happened: I placed a COD order worth ₹1,950 in Mumbai. The delivery partner named Arvind arrived and asked me to pay. He provided a scanner, and I made the payment through UPI without checking the invoice or verifying the link — my mistake, as I’ve trusted Amazon blindly for the past seven years. After payment, I realized that the amount was sent to his personal account. Within five minutes, I reported the issue to Amazon. They assured me that action would be taken within three days (on 23rd October). However, no refund or follow-up happened. Today, on 29th October, when I called again, Amazon simply said they had “warned” the delivery partner — as if it were a minor issue. Eventually, I received the refund, but in the form of a gift voucher instead of my original payment method. It’s shocking that such fraud is happening openly through Amazon India’s delivery network.

Did you know that if you have an accident with a flex driver and they are have someone else driving them your accident is not covered. Amazon will deny the claim and so will the personal Insurace. I am dealing with this now for almost a year. They know that these drivers are allowing others ppl to drive while on routes and yet are taking no responsibility. Due to the fact that the person driving is still in the scope of work the personal Insurace denies the claim as well.

And Our office was closed from 15th August to 17th August on occotion of Independance Day & Krishna Janmastami. To confirm this, you can see the record register and video along with the security guard of our office building. And if it has been delivered as per your system, please share the proof of delivery with us. We were not able to audit the stock as we were confident that there was no chance of any mistake on the part of Amazon. The value of this stock is around 17 lakhs which has been defrauded by the Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) team or your delivery partner. We have all the documents available to prove that this stock has not been received. Therefore, you are requested to kindly investigate it properly and take immediate action.

After filing multiple HR complaints regarding racial discrimination I experienced, I was wrongfully terminated. Meanwhile, the manager responsible for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior, Genelle Rose, including exposing team members to sexual content during a meeting, remains in her position. During this process, I had HR meetings with Alicia Panta, Hannah Park, Mike Gomez, and Rato, and was told that all of this behavior is considered acceptable by Amazon. It is disheartening to see that speaking up about discrimination can result in retaliation, while those engaging in misconduct face no consequences. Black employees and other marginalized groups deserve to work in environments where they are respected, valued, and treated equitably.

Amazon doesn’t just adapt to industries — it re-architects them: Sports & AI → Turning broadcasts into real-time cognitive experiences AWS Chips → Owning the physics layer of intelligence, not just the software Project Kuiper + JetBlue → Scaling the internet like oxygen, borderless and instant Lens Live → Blurring the line between perception and purchase 10-min Deliveries → Redefining “time to value” in commerce This isn’t diversification. It’s integration at godspeed ⚡ — every move compounding into Amazon’s meta-infrastructure. 🚀 The bigger vision? Amazon isn’t just an e-commerce giant. It’s an operating system for human activity — one where logistics, cognition, entertainment, and connectivity collapse into a single flow.

However, the return was never picked up despite multiple follow-ups. Now, I am being informed that the return window has closed or that the return cannot be processed, which is unacceptable. This is not just an operational issue—it is turning into a case of fraud, where a customer has been misled and denied rightful service. I followed all required steps within the timeline and have proof of the return request and communication (screenshots, emails, etc.). I request immediate action on the following: Arrange for the return pickup without further delay. Process the refund as per your return policy. Share a written confirmation and timeline for resolution. If this matter is not resolved within the next [2–3 business days], I will be forced to escalate the issue through consumer forums and legal channels. I expect a prompt and professional resolution.

I didn’t like the product, so I requested a return. A delivery boy called me and said he came for the return. He asked for the OTP, and I gave it to him. But later, I received an email showing that the product was marked as a replacement, not a return. I asked him about it, and he said, “Yes ma’am, it’s a return. You’ll receive your refund soon.” However, I have neither received my refund nor any replacement till now. I even have the call recording of that delivery boy. I request Amazon to either refund my money or send me the product I paid for. ₹1600 is not a small amount.

After filing multiple HR complaints regarding racial discrimination I experienced, I was wrongfully terminated. Meanwhile, the manager responsible for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior, Genelle Rose, including exposing team members to sexual content during a meeting, remains in her position. During this process, I had HR meetings with Alicia Panta, Hannah Park, Mike Gomez, and Rato, and was told that all of this behavior is considered acceptable by Amazon. It is disheartening to see that speaking up about discrimination can result in retaliation, while those engaging in misconduct face no consequences. Black employees and other marginalized groups deserve to work in environments where they are respected, valued, and treated equitably. I hope by sharing my experience, organizations and professionals take a hard look at workplace culture, accountability, and the protection of employees who speak up against injustice. #WorkplaceEquity #RacialJustice #EmployeeRights #StopRetaliation",Brittany Thigpen,Pay Advisor,,Other,0.0,negative,critical,toxic_culture,Harmful

The platform’s return policy is not merely flawed—it’s weaponized. Buyers routinely vandalize merchandise, return counterfeit or worthless items, and receive full refunds without scrutiny. Sellers like us absorb the losses, with no support, no investigation, and no justice. This is not a glitch. It’s a systemic failure. Worse—it’s corporate complicity. Amazon.eg’s refusal to enforce basic standards of fairness, to reimburse destroyed goods, or to hold abusive buyers accountable signals a disturbing truth: seller protection is not a priority. We are treated as disposable inventory, while fraudsters exploit the system with impunity. We urge Amazon’s leadership to confront this crisis. Review the policies. Investigate the abuse. Restore fairness. Because if Amazon continues to ignore the voices of its sellers, it risks losing the very foundation of its marketplace.

Their delivery partners are committing fraud, and Amazon’s response is extremely casual. Here’s what happened: I placed a COD order worth ₹1,950 in Mumbai. The delivery partner named Arvind arrived and asked me to pay. He provided a scanner, and I made the payment through UPI without checking the invoice or verifying the link — my mistake, as I’ve trusted Amazon blindly for the past seven years. After payment, I realized that the amount was sent to his personal account. Within five minutes, I reported the issue to Amazon. They assured me that action would be taken within three days (on 23rd October). However, no refund or follow-up happened. Today, on 29th October, when I called again, Amazon simply said they had “warned” the delivery partner — as if it were a minor issue. Eventually, I received the refund, but in the form of a gift voucher instead of my original payment method. It’s shocking that such fraud is happening openly through Amazon India’s delivery network. I’m sharing this so that others stay alert — please verify before making any UPI or COD payments",LD Sharma,Managing Director at Mayhigh Films | Ad Filmmaker | Brand Storytelling & Content Strategy Expert | Director & Creative Visionary,,Founder/Executive,0.9,negative,critical,credibility_overclaim,Harmful

Their delivery partners are committing fraud, and Amazon’s response is extremely casual. Here’s what happened: I placed a COD order worth ₹1,950 in Mumbai. The delivery partner named Arvind arrived and asked me to pay. He provided a scanner, and I made the payment through UPI without checking the invoice or verifying the link — my mistake, as I’ve trusted Amazon blindly for the past seven years. After payment, I realized that the amount was sent to his personal account. Within five minutes, I reported the issue to Amazon. They assured me that action would be taken within three days (on 23rd October). However, no refund or follow-up happened. Today, on 29th October, when I called again, Amazon simply said they had “warned” the delivery partner — as if it were a minor issue. Eventually, I received the refund, but in the form of a gift voucher instead of my original payment method. It’s shocking that such fraud is happening openly through Amazon India’s delivery network.

Their delivery partners are committing fraud, and Amazon’s response is extremely casual. Here’s what happened: I placed a COD order worth ₹1,950 in Mumbai. The delivery partner named Arvind arrived and asked me to pay. He provided a scanner, and I made the payment through UPI without checking the invoice or verifying the link — my mistake, as I’ve trusted Amazon blindly for the past seven years. After payment, I realized that the amount was sent to his personal account. Within five minutes, I reported the issue to Amazon. They assured me that action would be taken within three days (on 23rd October). However, no refund or follow-up happened. Today, on 29th October, when I called again, Amazon simply said they had “warned” the delivery partner — as if it were a minor issue. Eventually, I received the refund, but in the form of a gift voucher instead of my original payment method. It’s shocking that such fraud is happening openly through Amazon India’s delivery network.

After filing multiple HR complaints regarding racial discrimination I experienced, I was wrongfully terminated. Meanwhile, the manager responsible for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior, Genelle Rose, including exposing team members to sexual content during a meeting, remains in her position. During this process, I had HR meetings with Alicia Panta, Hannah Park, Mike Gomez, and Rato, and was told that all of this behavior is considered acceptable by Amazon. It is disheartening to see that speaking up about discrimination can result in retaliation, while those engaging in misconduct face no consequences. Black employees and other marginalized groups deserve to work in environments where they are respected, valued, and treated equitably. I hope by sharing my experience, organizations and professionals take a hard look at workplace culture, accountability, and the protection of employees who speak up against injustice. #WorkplaceEquity #RacialJustice #EmployeeRights #StopRetaliation",Brittany Thigpen,Pay Advisor,,Other,0.0,negative,critical,toxic_culture,Harmful

Meanwhile, sellers eat the cost, with zero recourse. Zero accountability. Zero shame. This isn’t incompetence—it’s complicity. Amazon.eg actively enables fraud by refusing to investigate abuse, refusing to reimburse for destroyed goods, and refusing to enforce even the most basic standards of fairness. Sellers are treated like expendable inventory, while con artists enjoy a revolving door of free merchandise. Amazon.eg isn’t a marketplace anymore. It’s a scam factory. A corporate-backed theft ring.
