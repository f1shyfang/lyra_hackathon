For anyone interested in communications, Sarah says one capability is essential: “The most important skill is the ability to translate complex technology into useful, digestible information.

In Alexandra’s words, her path to Google was “a journey defined by overcoming self-doubt and embracing opportunity.” During Alexandra’s first year of university, a classmate encouraged her to apply to one of Google’s student internship programs. “Honestly, I didn't believe I would be accepted,” she shared. “But I ultimately decided to apply, concluding that I had nothing to lose. That single decision was pivotal.” During her internship, Alexandra received mentorship, guidance, and “insight into real-world software development” — bridging the gap between academic theory and professional practice. She returned to Google the following summer, and today works as a backend engineer building secure and accessible systems that impact millions of users. One of the lessons Alexandra learned is that soft skills, such as effective team communication, are just as important as technical contributions. Adaptability — “being open to constantly learning, embracing change and adjusting your ways of working according to the needs of the team” — is equally vital. And ultimately, Alexandra advises all aspiring Googlers to believe in themselves. “Dare to apply and pursue the opportunities that intimidate you.” Explore our open roles and career opportunities → https://goo.gle/4kKGHrd",2025-12-01 22:58:52,2894,79.0,0.45569620253164556,0.16455696202531644,0.13924050632911392,0.05063291139240506,0.012658227848101266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9746835443037974,Low,Helpful,0.0,supportive signal,Low,Helpful,0.0,supportive signal,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77

In her role as a Product Manager on the User Protection team in Brazil, Googler Rebeca’s job is to ensure people’s safety when using our products. “My focus is on solving common abuse types in Google products, at scale,” she explains. ""My core work involves partnering with the teams behind Google products like Maps, Blogger, and Messages. I focus on two key areas: driving adoption, to ensure as many products as possible are protected by our safety platform, and expanding coverage, to make sure we can solve for the most common types of abuse they face."" This type of work requires constant strategic adjustment. ""Adaptability is crucial,” Rebeca shares. “The scale at Google means new data, new user trends, and new technologies emerge constantly. Being able to quickly learn and adjust your strategy is essential to keeping up and staying effective."" The power of her team's mission has also fueled her personal growth when it came to her fear of public speaking — giving her the courage to speak at an internal conference. ""Even though I had been working on it during my career, it was at Google that I had a turning point when I realized that the mission of our User Protection work, and the message that came with it, was bigger than my fear."" Rebeca’s advice for those interested in similar roles? ""If you are passionate about building products, Google gives you the opportunity to apply your skills at an unimaginable scale. The work you do here can genuinely impact the daily experience of billions of users.""

I had a chance to visit the Google Wrocław office and work with amazing Wroglers (Googlers from Wrocław).” Now, Aleksandra is a Software Engineer on the RCS (Rich Communication Services) for Business team, which is working to replace traditional SMS with a richer communication protocol. “My team works to provide our users with a pleasant, robust and safe experience when communicating with their favorite businesses,” she explains. “I take care of the Android app (Google Messages) part of the process. I develop various features for the app, but also create design documents, write tests, answer partner questions and sometimes fight the bugs.” She finds efficient communication to be one of the most crucial parts of her job: “Our team is based half in Kraków and half in San Jose, California. We also operate closely with the teams from Zurich and Hyderabad. This requires you to communicate with many people across many time zones, and to do it efficiently,” she says. Aleksandra credits her career path to taking a chance on community involvement. “I would definitely be in a different place right now if I didn’t dare to apply for that scholarship or to join Google Developers Group,” she says.

The Google Quantum AI team has successfully run an algorithm that can compute the structure of a molecule, with potential for real-world applications. Our Willow quantum processor ran the algorithm — which we’ve named “Quantum Echoes” — 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world’s fastest supercomputers. Importantly this computation is verifiable, which means its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments. This is the first time in history that any quantum computer has successfully run a verifiable algorithm that surpasses the ability of classical computers. With our latest breakthrough algorithm on Willow, we’re optimistic that within five years we’ll see real-world applications that are possible only on quantum computers.

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nickthefox_when-im-asking-friends-family-or-a-store-ugcPost-7394962444193914880-DKih,"When I’m asking friends, family, or a store associate for fashion ideas, I don’t just say: “work bag.” Instead I say what I’m *really* after, like: “I’m looking for a black leather work bag that’s comfortable, fits my laptop, and is appropriate for customer meetings.” 💼 Now with AI, technology is finally catching up to how we actually shop! At Google, we're leading this shift with AI that’s both conversational and agentic – meaning you can say what you want and then it’ll help you buy it: → Conversational: You can ask a shopping question in AI Mode (and follow up conversationally to refine), and get an AI-organized response that brings together rich visuals and all the details you need (like price, reviews, and inventory info). And we’re also bringing new shopping features to the Gemini app! Put another way, welcome to the era of ""vibe shopping"" :) → Agentic: Our agentic AI can call nearby businesses to check on products (like if the store has what you’re looking for in-stock) and promotions. And with agentic checkout, Google can track an item’s price and when the price drops for eligible merchants, you can give Google permission to complete the purchase for you. These updates are designed to support a thriving ecommerce ecosystem. Shoppers get to delegate the tedious parts of online shopping (but keep the fun and control!), and merchants can capture high-intent sales that might have otherwise been abandoned. It’s pretty awesome to see advancements like these even change my own shopping behavior.
