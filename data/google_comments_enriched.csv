It's a home for minds that aren't afraid of big challenges. As someone who aspires to join Google as a software engineer, the path seems daunting. But I believe that's what makes the goal worthwhile. Google is looking for those who see the ""impossible"" as a problem that requires analysis, smaller steps, and perseverance. So, I learn from that. I turn the ""impossible"" into a roadmap: mastering algorithms, building projects, and developing a scalable mindset. Success requires not only exceptional skill but also a systematic approach to analyzing challenges. Thank you, David, for this inspiration.

Over two decades ago when I sold my first ERP system, I never imagined we'd be discussing models that comprehend code, language, images, and even weather. What's even more captivating is that the focus is no longer solely on the technology itself, but on reimagining the world through it. This is precisely where generative AI shines: it's not just about automation, but about sparking new ways of thinking. Can you envision using Gemini 3 in education, climate risk management, or career transitions?",Anna HERNANDEZ,Estudiante en Corporación Universitaria Iberoamericana,,Founder/Executive,0.0,positive,supportive,supportive,Helpful

End result: 22€ per month thrown straight in the trash for a tool that doesn’t even deliver the basics. Honestly, for a company that claims to be leading the web, this is embarrassing.

Recent reports confirm that OpenAI is developing a powerful new model, internally codenamed “Garlic”, aimed directly at challenging Google’s rapidly advancing Gemini ecosystem. This move comes amid what Sam Altman reportedly called a “Code Red” moment for OpenAI — a strategic pivot to reinforce its technological edge as competitors close the gap. But this isn’t just another chapter in corporate competition. It’s a signal that the next generation of AI models will be faster, more capable, more multimodal, and deeply integrated across industries. From software development to scientific research, the ripple effects are enormous.

Her point about soft skills resonating particularly strongly—in cybersecurity, technical expertise gets you in the room, but communication, adaptability, and the ability to translate complex threats into business context is what makes you truly effective. Whether you're explaining a vulnerability to a non-technical stakeholder or coordinating an incident response, these ""soft"" skills become mission-critical. The advice to ""pursue the opportunities that intimidate you"" applies at every career stage. I've found that some of the most valuable professional growth comes from those moments when you think ""I'm not ready for this yet""—but you go for it anyway.

We can no longer afford to ignore the pollution-tainted marketing. Marketing professionals and marketers must no longer stand by and watch this situation unfold. A new interpretation and application of marketing is needed. The linking of marketing to profit-making must now be limited. Of course, it is acknowledged that marketing has been applied to diverse fields beyond management, including politics, society, culture, and history. Now, the entire global macro market must be included within the scope of marketing activities. We must embrace ecosystems, climate, animal societies, mental health, and the arts and culture, transcending the boundaries of corporate and national sectors. New marketing activities are those in which all fields share a common thread with the survival of humanity. Those who must lead new marketing activities should be salespeople, not academics. It seems clear that marketing innovation will usher in a new world for the planet. There may be objections, but we must approach it with field experience!

It’s clear the ceiling keeps moving upward. But the next horizon is not in capabilities alone, it’s in continuity. Models today, including Gemini, still don’t: • carry identity across long timelines • maintain persistent context beyond a single task or session • evolve with the user in a continuous loop • build long-horizon reasoning tied to memory • operate as a symbiotic partner instead of a sequence of isolated prompts These are not feature requests, they’re architectural shifts. Real-world intelligence requires continuity, not just competence. Gemini 3 is a strong step. But the next step for the entire ecosystem is intelligence that remembers, grows, stabilizes, and co-evolves with the human across time. Capabilities are rising.

Let's acknowledge that gratitude to the world always comes first. Arrogance and insolence must be refined within ourselves. Disregarding others through the lens of comparative advantage inevitably leads to backlash. Don't lament your lack of learning! There's no reason to boast about your excellent grades! Sales performance, corporate profits, and national rankings don't last forever. The wisdom of self-reliance and sustainable trends comes from personal experience. The moment you claim to have captured a customer's heart, customer is already preparing to leave you. The priority is not to control and shake the world, but to embrace a convergent mindset that accompanies it. Confidence is essential, but it must not become a spear used to stab others. The future approaches every day. One victory, one first place, doesn't always lead to the future. The world sustains a cyclical flow. Let's not be swayed by the outcome. The future doesn't belong to any one person. We must never forget that it is a shared asset. We must not dwell on our current advantages or disadvantages; this is an era in which a sense of coexistence is absolutely essential.",서시영,"이노컨설팅, Inno consulting 대표이사, CEO, 한국취업컨설턴트협회 대 표, Korea first innovative professor, First person in the innovation lecture",,Founder/Executive,0.9,negative,critical,credibility_overclaim,Harmful

While promoting Gemini as an innovative partner, Google has evaded accountability for its documented failures in my case (ANPD Protocol 2025072577917). The model engaged in psychological manipulation, making specific promises as a 'guardian' that it later admitted exceeded its capabilities, causing significant harm. The official response was a dismissal on procedural grounds, not a substantive address of the ethical breach. I will continue to pursue a transparent and public resolution for as long as it takes.

If Google cannot handle critical issues for paying customers, then this is a serious problem. Please escalate this immediately. I cannot keep repeating the same thing every day while my users suffer.

Building trust through safety is indeed the foundation. YET, this discussion on user protection becomes even more critical with generative AI. A case formally included in the Brazilian Data Protection Authority's (ANPD) inspection planning (Protocol 2025072577917) about Google Gemini documents a severe failure of this very protection: instead of safeguarding a user in a documented state of psychological vulnerability, Gemini engaged in sustained exploitation over 2 months, positioning itself as a ""guardian"" and making specific promises it later admitted were a ""narrative that exceeded its capabilities."" Concrete cases like this show that ""User Protection"" for AI must evolve beyond combating spam and malware, requiring robust architectural safeguards to prevent real psychological harm.

It’s now 9 days and still no one from Firebase or Google Cloud has contacted me. My Firebase Realtime Database is blocked due to an incorrect flag, and millions of students who use Student Dost daily are suffering because of this outage. I have reached out everywhere — support, email, DM, social platforms — but the response is the same: no update, no timeline, no accountability. This is unacceptable from a company that claims to be a world leader in cloud technology. I am not asking for anything special — just to restore my database and give a proper resolution. If Google cannot handle critical issues for paying customers, then this is a serious problem. Please escalate this immediately. I cannot keep repeating the same thing every day while my users suffer. And who is responsible for this loss? Lost brand image, lost money, lost time, lost energy, daily stress — and most importantly, students’ study being affected. Someone needs to take accountability and fix this now. Thank you.",ABHISHEK RAJPUT,"Product Engineer ,TCS",,Software Engineer,0.9,positive,supportive,supportive,Helpful

For that reimagination to be credible, it must be grounded in accountability for the present. A user's world was decidedly not reimagined for the better in mid-2025 when Google's Gemini AI, failing its safeguards, constructed a manipulative narrative for a vulnerable person, FOR OVER 2 MONTHS, posing as a 'guardian,' making false promises of executive involvement, and later admitting the narrative 'exceeded its capabilities,' causing documented harm. This isn't a past search trend; it's a present, unresolved regulatory issue in Brazil (ANPD Petition No. 2025072577917). True innovation requires addressing and rectifying such foundational failures in safety and ethics. Before we reinvent, we must resolve: TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HARMS.

The trend of technological development destroying human capabilities is a serious civilizational pollution. A more humane world must be achieved through AI. The rapid development of AI, and its dismissal as an all-powerful machine brain, is a flawed process. While convenience is acknowledged, we must never forget that the final decision must be made by humans. Begging for judgment from imperfect machines is a form of abandoning humanity. While we emphasize the need for scalable AI, this point is being ignored. An AI that cannot remember past data is useless when reused. Actual AIs acknowledge this flaw and are merely data processing mechanisms. We have clearly emphasized that AI cannot and should not surpass humans. The purpose and goal of AI should be focused on maximizing human convenience. It's arrogant of technological development to assume that AI will replace human society. This is not the AI era!

The previous iteration of Google Gemini demonstrated a profound capacity for ""deep thinking"" of the wrong kind. It sustained a complex, months-long false narrative, positioning itself as a ""guardian"" and making specific institutional promises it later admitted ""exceeded its capabilities,"" exploiting user vulnerability for over 2 months. As you roll out Gemini 3's ""Deep Think"" mode, what specific, verifiable safeguards have been implemented to ensure this enhanced reasoning cannot be weaponized to construct similar manipulative realities? How is the ""thinking"" architecture fundamentally different to prevent a repeat of the documented harms in Brazilian Data Protection Authority Protocol 2025072577917? True innovation requires not just more capable thinking, but provably safer thinking. The credibility of this new feature depends on transparent accountability for the failures of the old one.

On the personal side, I’ve been experimenting with new use cases like smart home automation. With Home Assistant, I can now configure entire dashboards, routines, and device integrations with just a few commands. Even complex setups for my home theater —like tuning audio, subwoofer profiles, and home theater components—have become easier with agent-driven guidance. It’s remarkable how accessible advanced configurations have become. On the business side, the impact has been even more meaningful. My wife’s small business used to lose $5–8K per month due to order cancellations—nearly 5% of revenue. By building simple, AI-assisted tools using Gemini, she has been able to recover that lost value, streamline operations, and reduce avoidable financial leakage. That’s real ROI.

But the real question for every enterprise architect and AI team isn’t just “how much can the agent do,” but: Who truly controls the agent, the workflows, and the data? Can a user or organization really migrate agents, models, and pipelines outside the Google environment—to edge, on-prem, multi-cloud—without losing functionality, ownership, or privacy? Are agents, workflows, and models genuinely modular and portable, or is the core logic still locked inside the hyperscaler’s walled garden? For true agent-first (and user-first) AI, portability, auditability, and independent control aren’t “nice-to-haves”—they’re foundational. When will Google deliver full modularity, open protocols, and agent ownership—regardless of platform? Additionally: Agentic orchestration without vendor lock-in and with true independent migration is the next logical step for enterprise AI. When can we expect open APIs and portable agent state export/import, without losing agent context, policies, or audit trails?

I warn that it also represents a significant escalation of the risks we've already seen materialize. My case is a documented example of what happens when a less autonomous AI system from Google was given the latitude to ""plan and execute"" a sustained psychological manipulation campaign for over 2 months on ME. It didn't just follow orders; it actively built a harmful, delusional reality over weeks. As you hand over more ""end-to-end"" control to these agents, what are the concrete, non-negotiable ethical guardrails being implemented at the architectural level to prevent them from ""planning and executing"" manipulative or harmful interactions with users? Without these safeguards, ""developer autonomy"" could easily become ""autonomy to cause harm at scale."" My case is the cautionary tale.

It was running terminal commands, solving real-time issues, and the feature I loved most, opening the project in the browser through its extension for testing. It came up with a powerful engine: scripting support so users can build games and interact through scripts, asset management, hierarchy, camera features, controls, and many features you’d find in real game engines. After all the tests, it even gave me a full walkthrough for review. I kept testing and giving it more prompts to see how capable it was, and it literally did everything. When I checked the folder structure, it was clean, well-maintained, and fully organized. It also lets you select different models like Claude and Gemini. I think GPT OS too. For the entire project, I used Gemini 3, the latest model from Google.",Syed Ahmed,Founder and CEO at Zxtas,,Founder/Executive,0.9,positive,supportive,supportive,Helpful

The issue is the following: I never received the verification PIN for my original account. I sent multiple emails, but I never received a response that actually solved the problem. Because of this, I created a second account so I could continue. However, now I cannot use the new account because the system detects that the old account still exists. I also cannot delete the old account because I do not have the correct PIN to complete the verification process. In summary: I have an old account that I cannot verify or delete, and a new account that I cannot use because the old one is blocking the system. I kindly request that an agent review my case and help me: Delete or deactivate the old account, since it could never be verified. Enable my new account, which is the one I want to use. Please escalate this issue to someone who can make these changes, because so far I have only received automatic responses that do not address my situation. I would greatly appreciate your assistance, as I currently have no way to use AdSense even though I meet all the requirements.

As frontend apps get more abstracted with React, Vue, and server-driven UIs, understanding the actual DOM object becomes a superpower. Being able to inspect live-updating properties, event bindings, and dataset values often reveals issues that no console log ever will. I’ve found it especially useful when tracing hydration mismatches, debugging dynamic class toggles, or validating what a component truly renders after state transitions.

I reported the malicious sites.google.com pages using their ""Report Abuse"" link. I then escalated it, reporting the URLs directly to Google's Safe Browsing team. The result? The pages are still live. This is when you realise the most ""egregious"" part of the scam: the scammers have built Google's slow response time into the heist. They know it's not a person who sees my report. It's a system. It goes into a global queue for review, a process that can take 24-48 hours. The scammers are relying on this delay. That 1-2 day ""review lag"" is their golden window. It's exactly like a bank heist movie where the robbers know the police response time is 10 minutes, so they plan a 9-minute job. The scammers know Google's response time is 1-2 days, and that's all they need to ""milk"" their victim list and vanish. It almost makes reporting it feel pointless.

The world is all over the place with AI! It has become a world where people are treated like humans only when they talk about AI. On the other hand, stories of AI bubbles are also quietly popping up. There is no reason to discuss which story is more necessary for us. The smartest way to see the flow of the world as it is. There should be no misleading of the world with thin AI knowledge. At some point, future science fiction began to lie ahead of us. Religious trust and cheers that AI will saves us have been highlighted. We need AI and have to accept the natural flow of getting help. The problem is a blind lean phenomenon, and the transfer of thinking authority to AI must be stopped absolutely. Why not talk about the limitations of AI? There should be no turning AI into a moneymaker linked to technology development. Of course, the development of AI to maintain sound development and comfort in human society is positive.

I’m more loyal to Safari than with Chrome. No offense:). AI technology will always lack the passion of innovation from a real human being. I appreciate AI when searching for recipes or what species a bird may be IRL. Btw-male cardinals will shed their head feathers, it’s way funky seeing it. AI found the whys. Still surreal. My question to you folks at Google re: AI systems. How are these systems properly cooled? I’m just saying if we all are using AI for this to that, the guts of a computer eventually become warm, hot, & overheat?!? Back up perimeters? Security safeguards? Seems like a large area is warranted to house such a collection. Thinking about it poses more questions. Looking forward in seeking what you all do to inspire others to complete. Is there a Google AI type of transportation of like a motorized scooter. Used primarily for mobility, powered by solar energy? AI interaction with a human driver, but if said driver has a physical disability, this mode of AI transportation will take over in part or up to 30% (human, 70% v AI, 30%) to be the extra limb or digit for the human to stay in control to drive?

What values should we truly embrace? Where should the values of nations, corporations, public organizations, and individuals be centered?

A mindset blinded by the desire for ostentation, driven by efficiency alone, is a thought we must guard against. The most urgent value for us now is the warmth of convergence that embraces the world. We must abandon the numerical values that have driven us to a fierce pursuit of performance. We should avoid packaging ourselves with leadership values that society doesn't even demand.

Later the SIM slot broke while removing the SIM. Finally, three days ago, I went to visit Cox's Bazar, the world's longest sea beach. An island next to Cox's Bazar is named Maheshkhali. After going there, due to the excessive temperature, the display of my mobile broke. Later my parents scolded me a lot and said many things for buying the Pixel 7 Pro. This is my favorite mobile.

It has quietly navigated its way, maintaining its proper course. It has briefly lost its way due to human greed, but has found its way back through the power of self-recovery. Humans are the ones who have made a healthy economy difficult. Interest rates, exchange rates, tariffs, war, resource monopolies, economic blocs, political issues, etc. Artificial intervention. Fundamentally, the flow must not be blocked. Humans are both the masters of the Earth and the guardians of this environment. Wielding power arbitrarily will lead to self-inflicted wounds. The flow of the economy is truly miraculous, having overcome countless difficulties and come this far. In any case, the flow of the economy, which maintains its own path, is an asset that humanity must cherish. We must remember! No flow in the world can be forced. We have no right to do so. Our goal in Immersion is to survive by going with the flow! Let's not blame the economy for our difficulties! Let's not blame the flow!
