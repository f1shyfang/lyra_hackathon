Because they feel locked out of the ""old playbook"" (like home ownership and standard dividends), they are aggressively pivoting to new strategies. Key takeaways: Risk as a Necessity: Younger investors are nearly 3x as likely to trade weekly compared to older investors and are far more willing to use margin to increase upside potential. The Asset Flip: They report having 25% of their portfolios in non-traditional assets (crypto, DeFi, derivatives), which is triple the allocation of older investors. The Death of the Traditional Advisor: Only 33% of younger investors rely on financial planners, compared to 51% of older investors. Instead, they are turning to YouTube, friends, and ""social trading"" to make decisions. The takeaway is clear: The emerging investor isn't just looking for a digital version of the stock market—they are looking for an ""Everything Exchange"" that offers 24/7 access to alternative assets to help them catch up.",Mateo Sanunga,"Senior EDI Specialist | X12, EDIFACT, API Integration | OTC Automation | Data Analysis | Retail & Logistics",,ML/AI/Data,0.55,positive,supportive,supportive,Helpful

One of the things that continues to stand out to me about Coinbase is the clarity and conviction behind its mission. It’s rare to see a company build its culture so intentionally around purpose, high ownership, and long-term thinking—especially in an industry that moves as quickly as crypto. What resonates most is the idea that culture isn’t built on consensus, but on alignment around a mission that truly matters. That approach attracts people who want to do meaningful work and who believe in the broader impact crypto can have on economic freedom. It’s inspiring to see Coinbase lean into that philosophy instead of diluting it. The Harvard Business School deep-dive reinforces what many of us already see from the outside: Coinbase is building something different, and doing it in a principled, mission-driven way.

This is the first real glimpse of what onchain personal finance could look like at scale. No fragmentation. No jumping between protocols. The user doesn’t even feel the infrastructure underneath.

If someone starts at 50% LTV and ETH drops about 24%, their LTV jumps to roughly 66%. Start nearer 70% and you are suddenly above 90%, which is where margin calls and forced selling usually kick in for normal users. Feels like the real value is pairing this with clear stress tests and guardrails. For example. “Here is what a 20 to 30% drawdown does to your LTV and when action is likely.” Are you seeing most people keep a big enough buffer, or do they still push close to the edge?",Hakan Mitrani,"Data & Operations Specialist | Turning Field Team Complexity into Simple, Scalable Processes | Member of TechUK & GM Chamber",,Ops,0.9,neutral,neutral,neutral,Harmless

Borrowing USDC against your Ethereum—without selling—shows how blockchain finance is starting to replace traditional lending models. This kind of on-chain collateral lending could easily become a big part of our financial future. But there’s another side to the story. As crypto-based borrowing expands and cash slowly disappears, every transaction becomes fully transparent and traceable. While that transparency is great for security and compliance, it can also create problems. People who rely on cash or value financial privacy could be negatively affected. Lower-income groups, who may already struggle with digital access or documentation, risk being pushed further to the margins in a system where every movement of money is monitored. So yes—ETH-backed loans are innovation in motion. But as we move toward a world of tokenized lending and the decline of cash, we need to make sure this evolution doesn’t come at the expense of those with the least financial flexibility.",Csaba Hogye,QA Specialist | Bilingual (Hungarian/English) | Content & Trust Safety | Digital Marketing QA | Web & Content Support,,Security,0.9,positive,supportive,supportive,Helpful

But as a major investor and ecosystem partner of CoinDCX, I request your urgent attention. Many retail investors — including myself — are facing avoidable financial losses on CoinDCX due to: • Wrong execution of Take-Profit orders • App glitches causing forced losses • Sudden delistings with <24 hrs notice • No forensic audit even after 2 months • Copy-paste responses to serious complaints These are not market risks — 👉 They are platform risks harming users. Indian investors trusted CoinDCX because of Coinbase’s credibility. Now, we request your leadership to: ✅ Review CoinDCX’s operational standards ✅ Ensure accountability and user protection in India ✅ Support fair resolution for affected users A respected brand like Coinbase Brian Armstrong should not allow its network partners to damage investor trust.

We won a multi-million dollar judgement against the defendant; a man that caused irreparable damage to my company and my family; through defamation, business disparagement and malicious breach of contract. In anticipation of our collections efforts, he moved everything to crypto. Every other crypto platform rejected this man, but Coinbase welcomes him with open arms. We submitted a subpoena to Coinbase on September 7th, so we could verify his accounts. There has been no response, whatsoever. There is no legal contact to follow-up with, no available support and even the form to submit for customer complaints does not work. It appears to our legal team that Coinbase is aiding and abetting a known conman and professional scam artist. This man has amassed significant wealth by scamming people out of their hard-earned money and now it all sits on the Coinbase exchange, where this conman knows he will be protected from law enforcement and the the judicial system. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cabo-platinum-secures-30-million-140000230.html Dana Wagner David Gondo Paul Grewal Anagh Tiwari Molly Abraham Yuliya Prokopyshyn Katie Fry-Paul",Mishan Andre,"The #1 Resource for Cabo Luxury Services | Villa Rentals, Luxury Homes & Resort Sales | Yachts & Jets",,Sales/BD,0.9,negative,critical,toxic_culture,Harmful

Despite my continuous follow-ups since August 2025, there’s been no resolution or compensation. Instead of addressing user concerns, CoinDCX has even started removing genuine investor comments from LinkedIn. Since CoinDCX represents itself as a Coinbase partner, I sincerely request @Coinbase to review this partnership and ensure investor protection and transparency are maintained. I trusted this ecosystem with my hard-earned money — now I only seek fairness, responsibility, and truth. 🔗 Listen my full story here: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7379782920527507456-tBao Brian Armstrong Emilie Choi CoinDCX Coinbase Sumit Gupta Neeraj Khandelwal Gautam Gambhir #InvestorRights #TransparencyMatters #JusticeForTraders #BoycottCoinDCX #CryptoIndia",Trapti G.,Retail Investor Advocate | Leading the Fight for Transparency & Accountability in Crypto Platforms | Seeking Justice for Wrongful Losses | #InvestorSafety #DigitalFinancialRights,,DevOps/SRE/Cloud,0.9,negative,critical,toxic_culture,Harmful

The blood of this loss is on their hands. My friend was a loyal Bybit user for years. His portfolio included SUI, FIL, and LTC in his spot account, along with USDT in a unified trading account — his entire life savings. His dream was simple and dignified: to sell these holdings during the next bull run and buy a family home. That Friday night, Bybit forcibly liquidated his account despite sufficient funds. He desperately tried to access the app to add margin and save his holdings, but the system failed, locking him out. Within moments, everything he had worked for was gone. The shock and despair were unbearable, and he ended his life shortly after. His wife is now fighting for justice, filing complaints with the CFTC and SFIO, calling for a full investigation into Bybit’s practices and the accountability of its leadership. This is not just a financial failure — it is an ethical collapse. When a platform’s greed and negligence destroy lives, they must face consequences.",Aldrin G,CEO at Lunaphone Inc.

My Coinbase account allows both the advanced and older standard UIs. In the standard UI, your system let me purchase Pepenode (which apparently isn’t officially supported). Coinbase took fees from those transactions and shows the tokens as being held in my Coinbase account as custodian. (Screenshots and transaction history have been provided to Support as proof.) However, I cannot convert or sell those tokens in any way. Even a $1 sell attempt errors out, and no convert option exists. I suspect it’s related to the network type (Base, ETH, Solana, etc.) not being properly configured, though that’s just my theory. I’ve reported this multiple times over several weeks and have been told it was escalated as a major issue, but the case was later closed with no follow-up. Support case numbers are listed below for reference. I’d appreciate someone contacting me about this and I'm happy to provide whatever is needed that I have no already. #25102614 #25006248 #24937937 #24925771 #24923959",David Fasick,Director of Customer Services & Support,,Engineering Manager/Tech Lead,0.6,negative,critical,toxic_culture,Harmful

We won a multi-million dollar judgement against the defendant; a man that caused irreparable damage to my company and my family; through defamation, business disparagement and malicious breach of contract. In anticipation of our collections efforts, he moved everything to crypto. Every other crypto platform rejected this man, but Coinbase welcomes him with open arms. We submitted a subpoena to Coinbase on September 7th, so we could verify his accounts. There has been no response, whatsoever. There is no legal contact to follow-up with, no available support and even the form to submit for customer complaints does not work. It appears to our legal team that Coinbase is aiding and abetting a known conman and professional scam artist. This man has amassed significant wealth by scamming people out of their hard-earned money and now it all sits on the Coinbase exchange, where this conman knows he will be protected from law enforcement and the the judicial system. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cabo-platinum-secures-30-million-140000230.html Dana Wagner David Gondo Paul Grewal Anagh Tiwari Molly Abraham Yuliya Prokopyshyn Katie Fry-Paul",Mishan Andre,"The #1 Resource for Cabo Luxury Services | Villa Rentals, Luxury Homes & Resort Sales | Yachts & Jets",,Sales/BD,0.9,negative,critical,credibility_overclaim,Harmful

We won a multi-million dollar judgement against the defendant; a man that caused irreparable damage to my company and my family; through defamation, business disparagement and malicious breach of contract. In anticipation of our collections efforts, he moved everything to crypto. Every other crypto platform rejected this man, but Coinbase welcomes him with open arms. We submitted a subpoena to Coinbase on September 7th, so we could verify his accounts. There has been no response, whatsoever. There is no legal contact to follow-up with, no available support and even the form to submit for customer complaints does not work. It appears to our legal team that Coinbase is aiding and abetting a known conman and professional scam artist. This man has amassed significant wealth by scamming people out of their hard-earned money and now it all sits on the Coinbase exchange, where this conman knows he will be protected from law enforcement and the the judicial system. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cabo-platinum-secures-30-million-140000230.html Dana Wagner David Gondo Paul Grewal Anagh Tiwari Molly Abraham Yuliya Prokopyshyn Katie Fry-Paul",Mishan Andre,"The #1 Resource for Cabo Luxury Services | Villa Rentals, Luxury Homes & Resort Sales | Yachts & Jets",,Sales/BD,0.9,negative,critical,credibility_overclaim,Harmful

Despite my continuous follow-ups since August 2025, there’s been no resolution or compensation. Instead of addressing user concerns, CoinDCX has even started removing genuine investor comments from LinkedIn. Since CoinDCX represents itself as a Coinbase partner, I sincerely request @Coinbase to review this partnership and ensure investor protection and transparency are maintained. I trusted this ecosystem with my hard-earned money — now I only seek fairness, responsibility, and truth. 🔗 Listen my full story here: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7379782920527507456-tBao Brian Armstrong Emilie Choi CoinDCX Coinbase Sumit Gupta Neeraj Khandelwal Gautam Gambhir #InvestorRights #TransparencyMatters #JusticeForTraders #BoycottCoinDCX #CryptoIndia",Trapti G.,Retail Investor Advocate | Leading the Fight for Transparency & Accountability in Crypto Platforms | Seeking Justice for Wrongful Losses | #InvestorSafety #DigitalFinancialRights,,DevOps/SRE/Cloud,0.9,positive,supportive,supportive,Helpful

We won a multi-million dollar judgement against the defendant; a man that caused irreparable damage to my company and my family; through defamation, business disparagement and malicious breach of contract. In anticipation of our collections efforts, he moved everything to crypto. Every other crypto platform rejected this man, but Coinbase welcomes him with open arms. We submitted a subpoena to Coinbase on September 7th, so we could verify his accounts. There has been no response, whatsoever. There is no legal contact to follow-up with, no available support and even the form to submit for customer complaints does not work. It appears to our legal team that Coinbase is aiding and abetting a known conman and professional scam artist. This man has amassed significant wealth by scamming people out of their hard-earned money and now it all sits on the Coinbase exchange, where this conman knows he will be protected from law enforcement and the the judicial system. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cabo-platinum-secures-30-million-140000230.html Dana Wagner David Gondo Paul Grewal Anagh Tiwari Molly Abraham Yuliya Prokopyshyn Katie Fry-Paul",Mishan Andre,"The #1 Resource for Cabo Luxury Services | Villa Rentals, Luxury Homes & Resort Sales | Yachts & Jets",,Sales/BD,0.9,negative,critical,credibility_overclaim,Harmful

Coinbase has been accused of playing a key role in efforts to rewrite money‑transmission laws and shift monetary authority into private hands.

This is exactly why Wall Street will never allow exchanges to hold customer assets. Separation = protection.","Trinh, C.","Architecting DAO & NFT’s future.

Based on my observations, scammers are leveraging this loophole to fraudulently extract between $500,000 to $1 million daily. This issue poses a significant risk to both user trust and platform integrity. I believe it is in everyone’s best interest to address this matter immediately. I am ready to share full details of the exploit in a secure and confidential manner. Please advise the appropriate next steps or the correct channel to submit this report (e.g., HackerOne or direct contact with your security team).

That's the sound of the glass ceiling SHATTERING! Coinbase ($COIN) is officially joining the S&P 500 next week (May 19th)! From the trenches of building Liquid Tokens, we've seen the grind, the skepticism, the outright FUD. And now? Now one of our own is stepping into the biggest spotlight in traditional finance. 💥 No More Ignoring Us: The big dogs have to pay attention now. Their index funds will hold COIN. Their analysts will cover it. We're on the main stage. 💥 Validation, Baby! For every developer, every founder, every user who believed when it wasn't easy – this is a massive stamp of approval on the potential and staying power of this technology and industry. 💥 Opening the Floodgates? This crack in the dam could lead to a wave of new interest, new capital, and new talent flowing into crypto. The conversation changes when crypto isn't just ""that internet money thing"" but a component of major market indices.

Unfortunately, my experience has been deeply disappointing.

Instead of addressing issues, the company continues to silence users who share their real stories.

We submitted a subpoena to Coinbase on September 7th, so we could verify his accounts. There has been no response, whatsoever. There is no legal contact to follow-up with, no available support and even the form to submit for customer complaints does not work. It appears to our legal team that Coinbase is aiding and abetting a known conman and professional scam artist. This man has amassed significant wealth by scamming people out of their hard-earned money and now it all sits on the Coinbase exchange, where this conman knows he will be protected from law enforcement and the the judicial system. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cabo-platinum-secures-30-million-140000230.html Dana Wagner David Gondo Paul Grewal Anagh Tiwari Molly Abraham Yuliya Prokopyshyn Katie Fry-Paul",Mishan Andre,"The #1 Resource for Cabo Luxury Services | Villa Rentals, Luxury Homes & Resort Sales | Yachts & Jets",,Sales/BD,0.9,negative,critical,credibility_overclaim,Harmful

Brock, While I support the use of AI in recruiting, there's a risk of missing strong candidates whose experience doesn’t exactly match job descriptions. For example, I recently applied to a role requiring GTM experience. While I don’t have direct GTM listed on my resume, I’ve worked with GTM principles for years. However, I recognize that without an exact keyword match, I may be filtered out before a recruiter even reviews my application. Over-reliance on AI screening could lead to overlooking capable candidates who bring real value, even if their experience isn’t a perfect 1:1 fit.

Too often, I read a posting that uses undefined jargon or language specific to the hiring company that doesn’t translate across sectors. Applicants are left guessing whether their qualifications match and struggle to tailor their resumes and cover letters to the posting. It often seems that these postings are written by HR professionals without review by the appropriate teams who would ultimately work with the candidate. Then, those same HR professionals are the ones doing the initial screening and often miss candidates who meet or exceed qualifications based on experience that translates well to the position but doesn’t translate well on paper because of poorly defined terms. I see this problem worsening with AI unless there is constsistent and continual involvement by non-HR and tech members of the company.

Let’s break it down, shall we? Ridiculously low speed: Just 7 TPS (Transactions Per Second) — not per minute, but still laughably low for a global payments system ⚠️🐢 Absurdly high fees: You expect mass adoption with sky-high transaction costs? Come on now… 💸🚫 Stuck in the past: This junk protocol is frozen in 2009–2010 tech. It's basically a digital fossil 🪦📉 Bitcoin will NEVER be adopted at scale by anyone with a working brain — not for daily transactions, not for remittances, not even for real-world use cases. It’s a clunky relic, nothing more. This kind of ad would be far better suited to the real future of finance: Coins that were actually designed for utility, speed, and scalability like: XRP, XLM, XDC, HBAR, FLR, SHX, VELO… These are the true utility giants that will drive mass adoption and change the world of payments, tokenization, and value transfer forever!

We won a multi-million dollar judgement against the defendant; a man that caused irreparable damage to my company and my family; through defamation, business disparagement and malicious breach of contract. In anticipation of our collections efforts, he moved everything to crypto. Every other crypto platform rejected this man, but Coinbase welcomes him with open arms. We submitted a subpoena to Coinbase on September 7th, so we could verify his accounts. There has been no response, whatsoever. There is no legal contact to follow-up with, no available support and even the form to submit for customer complaints does not work. It appears to our legal team that Coinbase is aiding and abetting a known conman and professional scam artist. This man has amassed significant wealth by scamming people out of their hard-earned money and now it all sits on the Coinbase exchange, where this conman knows he will be protected from law enforcement and the the judicial system. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cabo-platinum-secures-30-million-140000230.html Dana Wagner David Gondo Paul Grewal Anagh Tiwari Molly Abraham Yuliya Prokopyshyn Katie Fry-Paul",Mishan Andre,"The #1 Resource for Cabo Luxury Services | Villa Rentals, Luxury Homes & Resort Sales | Yachts & Jets",,Sales/BD,0.9,negative,critical,toxic_culture,Harmful

The Boomer Exodus: Crypto, Trump, and Common Sense The fading power of baby boomers ushers in a new era, potentially reshaped by cryptocurrency and Donald Trump's pragmatic leadership. Boomers leave a mixed legacy of debt and outdated systems. Cryptocurrency offers financial freedom, sidestepping traditional constraints. Trump's return could mean deregulation and innovation, resonating with those seeking results over bureaucracy. This shift promises a landscape where startups and blockchain thrive, potentially revitalizing America. However, we must learn from past activism to avoid over-correction. The blend of crypto's decentralization and Trump's straightforward approach might spark a new American renaissance, where opportunity blooms and corruption diminishes.

We won a multi-million dollar judgement against the defendant; a man that caused irreparable damage to my company and my family; through defamation, business disparagement and malicious breach of contract. In anticipation of our collections efforts, he moved everything to crypto. Every other crypto platform rejected this man, but Coinbase welcomes him with open arms. We submitted a subpoena to Coinbase on September 7th, so we could verify his accounts. There has been no response, whatsoever. There is no legal contact to follow-up with, no available support and even the form to submit for customer complaints does not work. It appears to our legal team that Coinbase is aiding and abetting a known conman and professional scam artist. This man has amassed significant wealth by scamming people out of their hard-earned money and now it all sits on the Coinbase exchange, where this conman knows he will be protected from law enforcement and the the judicial system. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cabo-platinum-secures-30-million-140000230.html Dana Wagner David Gondo Paul Grewal Anagh Tiwari Molly Abraham Yuliya Prokopyshyn Katie Fry-Paul",Mishan Andre,"The #1 Resource for Cabo Luxury Services | Villa Rentals, Luxury Homes & Resort Sales | Yachts & Jets",,Sales/BD,0.9,negative,critical,toxic_culture,Harmful
