On the work front, we had the delight of attending OpenAI x NextGen Ventures’s AI Founder Fireside event! It was a valuable chance to hear perspectives from builders operating at the frontier of AI, with insights that sparked ideas and offered practical takeaways for anyone building in the space. In lighter news, we are proud to introduce a new office culture initiative: Lyra Clubs 🌱 A dedicated spaces for coworkers with shared hobbies to connect, unwind, and build community. From sports like badminton, futsal, & basketball, to pilates & matcha, to edutainment like robotics & chess, gaming, and social hangouts (office game nights, post work dessert runs), there’s something for everyone. Truly no excuses to skip team bonding 🙅‍♀️ Huge shoutout to Daniel Song and all the club reps helping bring these to life! To fully wrap up LyraLympics, Team CCP finally claimed their prize! A well-deserved trip to Build-A-Bear 🎉 And to round out the week, our engineers enjoyed a poker dinner filled with laughs, big bluffs, and even bigger losses (joking). 🃏 😎 We’re also preparing a special end-of-year celebration for the whole Lyra team, so keep an eye out for updates as we wrap up 2025 🫣 With Lyrathon S1 just around the corner, our Ops and Growth teams are working tirelessly to ensure a smooth and memorable experience for all participants.

He pushed important code for his client, all whilst the team moving and the product flowing. He kept the office vibe alive, checking in on teammates and sharing knowledge wherever he went. 🏃‍♂️ He even went for an afternoon walk, because leading culture also means leading by example. ☕ Another great week for Daniel at Lyra.

Conversations like this usually come from people who care about the same ecosystem we do. The message I shared recently was meant for founders and builders in Australia. The point wasn’t about working till 11:30pm. It was about ambition and what it takes to close the gap between what’s possible here and what’s already happening in the world. Lyra was built for people who want to build. Many of our engineers dream of starting companies, and our role is to create a support system with revenue, environment, and a community so they can pursue these ambitions (with the highest chance of success). I believe drive looks different for everyone. Some want balance, some want to push limits. Both belong here. Im proud of what Lyra's building.

We cover: → Why XML-based streaming leads to layout jumps, lag, and broken components → Why structured JSON chunks are way more stable → How “normalised chat states” work (position arrays + repositories) → The simple but powerful pattern that makes Claude-style streaming smooth → Real examples of bad vs. good implementations If you’re building AI chat interfaces, this pattern will save you hours of pain + and your frontend will thank you. 🎥 Watch Ep 1: Normalising chat states & Let us know what topic you want us to cover next in Software Sauce 👇 #lyra #sydney #softwaresauce",2025-11-27 00:00:05,48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Low,Harmless

The goal was to reimagine what college guidance could look and feel like, modern, warm, and genuinely supportive. Mirelle Education is a college admissions mentorship and life coaching practice that helps middle and high school students discover their interests, build meaningful projects and grow into confident independent learners. 97% of their students are admitted to one or more of their top choice colleges.

Not just in our business, but in our team. Each new member brings us one step closer to our goal of Lyra100, and this past month has been a massive leap forward. We’re thrilled to introduce some incredible new hires who have officially joined our journey: First, a big welcome to our newest engineers starting their journey at Lyra in the past week: John Phan, Roger Truong, Raymond Luo, Jarrod Wong and Bing Rong Jiang. Before he arrived, John has already made his mark by earning his own wiki page (lol.fandom.com/wiki/Mfis), Roger got in with the sickest portfolio, Raymond was killing it in one of our most technical interviews yet, Jarrod has been a god level programmer since age 12, and Bing showed up with a 2.3k chess ELO. These stats don't lie - the Lyra roster is absolutely stacked. Next, we’re excited to introduce the newest members of our Growth division, Duke Phan, Hugh Phan and Annsley Lin. Duke and Hugh are the creative geniuses behind our Lyra Lineup series, bringing their unmatched editing skills and fresh new ideas to our content, while Annsley is already making an impact behind the scenes, helping our team continue to drive growth forwards. Beyond the work, Lyra’s office culture has been unbeatable. This month, Kieren Huynh cleaned up at the poker table with an all-in win, Daniel Song rallied the first-ever Lyra badminton team while also smashing through the Ironman challenge, and the crew made the most of Sydney’s spring sunshine with balcony lunches and good vibes all around. 🌞 Here's to a week of incredible growth and good times. 🥳 🎉 Want to be a part of our journey?
