On the work front, we had the delight of attending OpenAI x NextGen Ventures’s AI Founder Fireside event! It was a valuable chance to hear perspectives from builders operating at the frontier of AI, with insights that sparked ideas and offered practical takeaways for anyone building in the space. In lighter news, we are proud to introduce a new office culture initiative: Lyra Clubs 🌱 A dedicated spaces for coworkers with shared hobbies to connect, unwind, and build community. From sports like badminton, futsal, & basketball, to pilates & matcha, to edutainment like robotics & chess, gaming, and social hangouts (office game nights, post work dessert runs), there’s something for everyone. Truly no excuses to skip team bonding 🙅‍♀️ Huge shoutout to Daniel Song and all the club reps helping bring these to life! To fully wrap up LyraLympics, Team CCP finally claimed their prize! A well-deserved trip to Build-A-Bear 🎉 And to round out the week, our engineers enjoyed a poker dinner filled with laughs, big bluffs, and even bigger losses (joking). 🃏 😎 We’re also preparing a special end-of-year celebration for the whole Lyra team, so keep an eye out for updates as we wrap up 2025 🫣 With Lyrathon S1 just around the corner, our Ops and Growth teams are working tirelessly to ensure a smooth and memorable experience for all participants.

He pushed important code for his client, all whilst the team moving and the product flowing. He kept the office vibe alive, checking in on teammates and sharing knowledge wherever he went. 🏃‍♂️ He even went for an afternoon walk, because leading culture also means leading by example. ☕ Another great week for Daniel at Lyra.

Conversations like this usually come from people who care about the same ecosystem we do. The message I shared recently was meant for founders and builders in Australia.

Lyra was built for people who want to build. Many of our engineers dream of starting companies, and our role is to create a support system with revenue, environment, and a community so they can pursue these ambitions (with the highest chance of success). I believe drive looks different for everyone. Some want balance, some want to push limits. Both belong here. Im proud of what Lyra's building.

We cover: → Why XML-based streaming leads to layout jumps, lag, and broken components → Why structured JSON chunks are way more stable → How “normalised chat states” work (position arrays + repositories) → The simple but powerful pattern that makes Claude-style streaming smooth → Real examples of bad vs. good implementations If you’re building AI chat interfaces, this pattern will save you hours of pain + and your frontend will thank you. 🎥 Watch Ep 1: Normalising chat states & Let us know what topic you want us to cover next in Software Sauce 👇 #lyra #sydney #softwaresauce",2025-11-27 00:00:05,48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Medium,Harmless,1.0,mixed/neutral,Medium,Harmless,1.0,mixed/neutral,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We officially launched #Lyra100, our mission to grow the team to 100 engineers by the end of this year. Even more talented engineers joined the fold (welcome Vincent Xian and Sarah Atkinson), pushing us closer to that goal. 📈 We also announced our $1000 referral bonus, with a reel launched by Hugh Phan to kick it off. On the partnerships front, we’ve been cooking up new collaborations (stay tuned 👀), while also celebrating a massive client win with Alloy, a true testament to the work and collaboration happening every day at Lyra. Outside the office, we were out at UNSW Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSESoc)'s Tech n’ Tonic, where Lyra came on as one of the sponsors. The event was packed with great conversations, drinks, and networking with the next generation of engineers. 🍸 We also dropped by UNSW Software Development Society (DevSoc)'s Hackathon, where our COO Anh Dao joined as a speaker and judge, congrats to the ShopLyft team for taking home the win! 💪 And of course, our office culture is peak.
