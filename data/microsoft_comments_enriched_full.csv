https://www.linkedin.com/posts/meta_lifeatmeta-womenintech-gracehopper2025-activity-7406713486380085248-6R72,"This post is a powerful testament to the strength of diverse leadership and a growth-mindset culture at Meta. Seeing Hind Hobeika, Kelly Ingham, Ming Hua, and Shira Gordon share their journeys is incredibly motivating. The key takeaways resonate deeply: 1. ""Nonlinear paths embraced"" is a crucial message. It validates the experiences of so many professionals whose careers aren't a straight ladder, but a mosaic of skills, pivots, and learning. 2. ""Curiosity fueled their rise"" highlights that in fast-moving fields like wearables and AI, technical skill must be paired with a relentless desire to learn and question. 3. The tangible outcome of ""5 products shipped in one year"" proves that this leadership style isn't just inspirational—it's exceptionally effective and execution-oriented. By showcasing these women leaders at Grace Hopper, Meta does more than share career tips; it actively models the future of tech: one that is innovative, human-centric, and built by a wide range of perspectives. This is how you redefine careers and build the next generation of products. Thank you to the panelists and Julia L. for sharing these insights.

O conceito é simples e disruptivo: um leilão que funciona a partir de estímulos emocionais, transformando reações humanas em indicadores reais de valoração. O EmoBid cria uma experiência totalmente nova, onde dados emocionais orientam decisões, interações e oportunidades dentro da plataforma. É um modelo que abre espaço para novas formas de engajamento, análise e criação de valor — algo que ainda não existe no mercado. Atualmente, o projeto está em fase de estruturação e validação, e estou avançando nos protótipos e no design da experiência. 🔹 Economia emocional aplicada 🔹 Interpretação de comportamento em tempo real 🔹 Oportunidade para inovação e diferenciação no mercado 🔹 Conceito escalável para tecnologia, marketing, jogos e plataformas sociais Se você trabalha com inovação, tecnologia, comportamento humano, AI ou simplesmente se identifica com ideias que fogem do comum, ficarei feliz em trocar insights — e talvez até construir algo juntos.

It was permanently banned for ""sexual exploitation"" after I posted normal photos of my son. My account was previously restricted for referencing the HP brand in a business post. After requesting an appeal, I edited the post, but within an hour, I was asked to appeal again—only to have my account permanently banned for ""sexual exploitation."" I’m frustrated and confused, as I believe this is a clear misinterpretation. Upon reflection, the only possible content that could have been flagged was a video from last year of my 3years son swimming in a baby pool. All other posts are normal travel and family photos. As a mother, sharing moments with my child should not be an issue—Facebook should not unreasonably restrict such content. This appears to be a false judgment, and with no further recourse available through standard channels, I am reaching out here to request account restoration or guidance on resolving this issue.

My Instagram account was suspended, but the entire appeal system is broken.

Every route you provide loops back to the same dead end. I’ve been on your platforms for over 15 years, and I’m about to lose all my photos, conversations and history because the appeal flow itself is not working.

It was permanently banned for ""sexual exploitation"" after I posted normal photos of my son. My account was previously restricted for referencing the HP brand in a business post. After requesting an appeal, I edited the post, but within an hour, I was asked to appeal again—only to have my account permanently banned for ""sexual exploitation."" I’m frustrated and confused, as I believe this is a clear misinterpretation. Upon reflection, the only possible content that could have been flagged was a video from last year of my 3years son swimming in a baby pool. All other posts are normal travel and family photos. As a mother, sharing moments with my child should not be an issue—Facebook should not unreasonably restrict such content. This appears to be a false judgment, and with no further recourse available through standard channels, I am reaching out here to request account restoration or guidance on resolving this issue.

This decision is clearly the result of a malfunction in Facebook’s moderation AI, which increasingly makes arbitrary decisions without proper human review. I am one of thousands of users who have been unfairly affected by these automated suspensions, often without clear notice, without a precise explanation, and most importantly, without any effective appeal process. This situation is unacceptable and severely undermines users’ trust in the platform. My account is an essential tool for me, and I refuse to be the victim of a faulty algorithm. I therefore request the immediate reopening of my account and a thorough human review of my case. I also want to make it clear that I am fully determined to defend my rights. I will take all necessary actions across all communication channels — including social media, press, and user advocacy organizations — to ensure this injustice is recognized and corrected, not only for myself but also for all others affected by these wrongful suspensions.",Christophe Gauthey,Hebergeur de site web - Créateur de site web - Createur de web serie - Producteur - Photographe attitré pour (Chut on écoute la tele) et je converti des cassettes VHS minidv et video8 vers le numérique,,Product Manager,0.55,positive,supportive,supportive,Helpful

And when you contact support, you just go in circles — same robotic answer every time: “Sorry, the decision was made by our automated system.” 🔒 The result? You lose your time ⏳ You lose your money 💸 Your entire business gets paused for no logical reason. How can a billion-dollar company rely entirely on an AI system with no sense of logic or fairness?

Great advice. As a former user, can I say no to Meta’s subpar customer service, flawed appeals system, and total lack of human support? My Facebook account was disabled in March 2025. My Instagram account was followed in June. No warning. No explanation. No one to talk to. Just a silent lockout. And I’m not alone; thousands of users are reporting the same treatment. If Meta is allowed to say “no” to basic accountability, Then users have every right to say “no” to platforms that ignore their own policies, violate trust, and pretend there’s no issue. Even the BBC and other media outlets have reported on this growing problem. A petition now has 43,000+ signatures from affected users: 🔗 https://www.change.org/p/meta-wrongfully-disabling-accounts-with-no-human-customer-support So yes I’m saying no. ❌ No to silence. ❌ No to automated injustice. ❌ No to being treated like a number. ❌ And no to gaslighting dressed up as empowerment.

Chciałbym dołożyć perspektywę z zupełnie innego miejsca — z terenu, z pracy z ludźmi, z realnych systemów energetycznych. W Polsce tworzę modele AI, które działają nie w salach konferencyjnych, lecz w domach użytkowników PV, pomp ciepła i nowych technologii, gdzie pojawia się codzienny chaos informacyjny i brak wsparcia. I widzę jedno: 🔸 AI ma największy wpływ tam, gdzie ludzie są pozostawieni sami z technologią, nie tam, gdzie prowadzi się o niej dyskusje. 🔸 Prawdziwy przełom zaczyna się, gdy model nie tylko „odpowiada”, ale bierze odpowiedzialność za prowadzenie użytkownika krok po kroku. 🔸 Najbardziej innowacyjne nie są już same algorytmy — tylko to, jak AI łączy człowieka z systemem, w sposób etyczny i zrozumiały. Dlatego budując WitnessAI pracuję nad jednym: systemową, etyczną inteligencją użytkową, która w realnym środowisku pomaga ludziom zrozumieć i oswoić technologię, zamiast ich przytłaczać. Świat AI potrzebuje nie tylko wielkich modeli, ale także jednostek, które łączą je z człowiekiem.

Despite paying for verification and support, responses have been generic “please wait” messages with no escalation or case ownership—this is unacceptable for paying customers and creators. This is a broken state machine: the system demands an additional ID but offers no upload mechanism, leaving the account locked and harming campaign commitments and partner obligations. Call to action: enable the alternate ID upload flow or complete manual review immediately, assign a real case ID, and publish an ETA from the Identity/Account Access teams. Public accountability matters—commit here, in this thread, to fixing the verification loop and to improving paid support beyond copy‑paste replies. Creators and businesses affected by the same verification dead end: add a comment below with “ID loop—no upload option” so this gets prioritized and tracked by the team.

As a consequence, I've lost my personal Facebook, Instagram, messenger, and access to our business pages. Thousands of photos of my wedding, child and entire life. The appeal was rejected by AI in 10 seconds. I'm an attorney living in Singapore who works next door to your HQ, yet it's impossible for me to work out how to properly appeal this incorrect or arbitrary decision. The account is linked to adamg1987@gmail.com. Please can someone assist? It will take 2 seconds for a human to review whatever post was reported to realise that there has been no breach of the guidelines.

The Meta help system doesn’t seem to work at all. It’s very clear my accounts have been hacked, yet Meta hasn’t taken any action. Insted my accounts have been disabled, and I can no longer access them since all passwords were changed. My profiles were modified, and my third-party authentication code was disabled and replaced by the hacker. None of your support forms are working. I even purchased a verified account and submitted three support cases with the following reference IDs: 1. 1186649796668340 2. 1280590147173400 3. 799826266196701 Each case was closed within about 20 minutes without any helpful response or resolution. These accounts are extremely valuable to us, as we’ve built and maintained them for years. I urgently request that someone with the proper authority review this situation and help me recover access as soon as possible. Can you please help me Meta?

Because here’s mine: If Meta can build hardware for AI at a global scale, it should be able to offer basic human support when AI disables a user’s account. My Facebook was disabled in March 2025, and my Instagram in June, username kevcon1079. No warning. No contact. No appeal. I’ve spoken with creators, business owners, and everyday users in the same position, locked out by automation with no path to resolution. RNZ reporters have even interviewed me about this growing accountability gap. Meta’s AI can build infrastructure dreams, but if it breaks trust at the user level, what’s the cost? 🔗 Petition: https://www.change.org/p/meta-wrongfully-disabling-accounts-with-no-human-customer-support #MetaSupport #PlatformAccountability #DigitalRights #CustomerSupport #AI",Kevin Conway,Force Health Protection Technician at New Zealand Defence Force,,Other,0.0,negative,critical,credibility_overclaim,Harmful

Since then, I haven’t been able to get back in. The problem: All accounts share the same email, but I can’t validate the logged-out one through any of the others. Facebook, linked to the same email, doesn’t help. I changed my phone number, and the only verification options are SMS or two-factor backup codes — both unusable if I’ve lost access. The help page just loops back to the same links, with no solution. The Meta Help Hub offers no real support — no chat, no email, no effective AI. I’ve been locked out of my main business account for two days, which I rely on for clients and communication. 📢 I urge someone from Meta/Instagram to see this. I’d rather not take legal action, but right now it seems to be the only option.

He’s been a long-time META user, using the platforms both personally and professionally, always with integrity and respect. These accounts are his main communication tools and contain important conversations, proof of credibility, professional content, and valuable personal materials. We even subscribed to Meta Verified on my account to seek support, but it didn’t help restore his profiles. He also created two new Facebook and two Instagram accounts, but all were deactivated shortly after creation — without any chance to appeal or understand what’s going on. We trust META as a company that values its users. However, despite several attempts through support channels, we received no response. Given this situation, what else can be done to recover his accounts?

Since then, I haven’t been able to get back in. The problem: All accounts share the same email, but I can’t validate the logged-out one through any of the others. Facebook, linked to the same email, doesn’t help. I changed my phone number, and the only verification options are SMS or two-factor backup codes — both unusable if I’ve lost access. The help page just loops back to the same links, with no solution. The Meta Help Hub offers no real support — no chat, no email, no effective AI. I’ve been locked out of my main business account for two days, which I rely on for clients and communication. 📢 I urge someone from Meta/Instagram to see this. I’d rather not take legal action, but right now it seems to be the only option.
