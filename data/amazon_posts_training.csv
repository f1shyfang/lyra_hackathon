They can be a periscope, rising us up out of our echo chambers to tell us what people really think. As the leader of Communications & Corporate Responsibility, I am particularly fond of the surveys that get at how people feel about the company broadly – what we offer to consumers and businesses, but also our communities, the planet, partners (think SMBs) and our employees. Last year, Forbes introduced a new survey called “Forbes Most Trusted Companies in America” that analyzes 1,500 companies across multiple factors, including employee satisfaction, consumer trust, financial performance, and public sentiment. In last year’s list, we didn't rank so our team made sure that Forbes saw Amazon as both a tech and retail company (they previously only viewed us as a retailer), and that they knew about all the good things we were doing for customers, employees, and our communities. Forbes came out with the new 2026 yesterday, and I couldn’t be happier and more proud to report that Amazon ranked #2 on Forbes' Most Trusted Companies in America. This recognition is the result of the work our teams do every day to live the CCR Vision, ensuring that our customers’ lives, communities, and the planet are better because of Amazon, and that people know about it. Very grateful for all our teammates do every day to help the company earn this level of trust, which might be the most valuable asset we have as a company.
