At Meta, we believe that open hardware and collaborative innovation are key to building the next generation of AI-ready data centers. This year, our team has announced: ➡️ The evolution of our Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric (DSF), now supporting building-scale, non-blocking fabrics for large AI clusters. ➡️ Our new Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF) architecture, leveraging shallow-buffer 51T Ethernet switches to drive lower latency and higher performance for our largest gigawatt-scale clusters. ➡️ The launch of Minipack3N, a 51.2 Tbps switch based on NVIDIA Spectrum-4, and new optics for 400G/800G interconnects. ➡️ Meta’s role as a founding participant in the Ethernet for Scale-Up Networking (ESUN) initiative, working with industry leaders to advance open standards for AI networking. For those at the show, we even gave a sneak peek of our next-generation, liquid-cooled rack full of network switches, aligned to the power density curve of future accelerators - more on that coming… These advances are the result of deep cross-team collaboration and a shared commitment to open, scalable, and efficient infrastructure. I’m grateful to work alongside so many talented engineers and partners – both at Meta, and across the OCP community. 👉 Read the full blog post: https://lnkd.in/g-33_3CZ If you’re passionate about open hardware, AI, and the future of networking, I invite you to join the conversation and help shape what comes next. #OCP2025 #OpenCompute #AIInfrastructure #OpenHardware #Meta",2025-10-16 00:43:54,417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Medium,Harmless,1.0,mixed/neutral,Medium,Harmless,1.0,mixed/neutral,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

His journey at Meta highlights the valuable impact that interns can have in a short amount of time. 🌎 Aayan shares first-hand how interning at Meta has given him the opportunity to make impact at scale: ""I chose Meta because of the impact I could have as an engineer here. Meta's products connect nearly half the world and help bring them closer. There is no other place where someone can make such a big impact. Working at Meta has been a rewarding experience as I got to work with people who have solved some of the biggest technical challenges and scaled products from a few hundred users to billions.” 🌱 Beyond impact, Aayan has also experienced significant career growth: ""Interning at Meta has made me an exponentially better engineer — it has taught me how to unblock myself, know when to ask for help, and learn new things quickly. Something that really surprised me was how much autonomy engineers have and how much of the new ideas come bottom-up. Meta empowers its engineers, PMs and designers to constantly improve its products and deliver a better experience to its users."" Aayan’s story is just one example of how the culture at Meta fosters growth, innovation and autonomy. Stay tuned for more inspiring intern journeys as we continue the series!
